abstract={The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims at levelling the commercial playing field between the European Union and the United States of America by, e.g., lowering tariffs to promote trade between the two economies. However, since early 2014, that is, even before the treaty negotiations could lead to concrete output, the free trade agreement has been faced with protests from both sides of the Atlantic and from individuals/groups from various ideological backgrounds. This paper draws on a corpus-assisted approach to examine how the TTIP is reported on in the Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung (Krone). Among other reasons, the newspaper was chosen as a source of data due to its clout as “the most widely read paper in the advanced industrialized world” “[i]n terms of readership per capita […] (Art, 2006). Indeed, the newspaper's influence has remained steady at a readership of 40 to 47% (Meyer & Rosenberger, 2015). The corpus examination has found that the newspaper predominantly employs a nationalist discourse in order to elicit its readership's rejection of the TTIP. Apart from cultivating resistance against this trade agreement, the newspaper's reporting on the TTIP might affect its readership in (further) honing and normalising nationalist attitudes and general opposition against international cooperation. Moreover, the Krone might attract hitherto unreached segments of the Austrian population who, opposing the TTIP, are willing to join the Krone's counter-TTIP campaign and are then vulnerable to subscribing to the newspaper's more general discursive choices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Focusing on the methodological challenges and the empirical dimension of transatlantic theory transfer, this article provides an overview of the concepts and ideas of theory transfer. By examining the deployment of the term and by reconstructing the respective concepts of theory, it considers the specific traditions in Germany and the United States. Providing statistical data, the article sheds light on success stories of transatlantic theory transfer from Germany to the United States and thus reassesses the concepts outlined in the first part. © 2017 by New German Critique, Inc.},

abstract={The recent upsurge of interest in Reinhart Koselleck's work across disciplines makes it even more conspicuous that his historical epistemology was rarely evoked-for example, in the excruciating debates about the linguistic turn in the 1980s and 1990s. Although there were repeated transatlantic encounters with Koselleck's work and briefly even with him as a teacher (in Chicago and New York around 1990), other German theoretical impulses were much more influential not only for Anglophone historians. Up until very recently, Koselleck was perceived either as a conservative historian and anti-utopian ideologue à la François Furet or, more narrowly, as a Begriffshistoriker, that is, historian of concepts à la John Pocock and Quentin Skinner, or as a metahistorian à la Hayden White. Of course, Koselleck repeatedly insisted that all these interests belong together. Yet only the essays published in three volumes in the years immediately before and after his death in 2006 make apparent how these different interests are laced together in his theory of possible histories, his Historik. © 2017 by New German Critique, Inc.},

abstract={While public opinion about foreign policy has been studied extensively in the United States, there is less systematic research of foreign policy opinions in other countries. Given that public opinion about international affairs affects who gets elected in democracies and then constrains the foreign policies available to leaders once elected, both comparative politics and international relations scholarship benefit from more systematic investigation of foreign policy attitudes outside the United States. Using new data, this article presents a common set of core constructs structuring both American and European attitudes about foreign policy. Surveys conducted in four countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany) provide an expanded set of foreign policy-related survey items that are analysed using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). Measurement equivalence is specifically tested and a common four-factor structure that fits the data in all four countries is found. Consequently, valid, direct comparisons of the foreign policy preferences of four world powers are made. In the process, the four-factor model confirms and expands previous work on the structure of foreign policy attitudes. The article also demonstrates the capability of ESEM in testing the dimensionality and cross-national equivalence of social science concepts. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Restrictions on the carriage of liquids, aerosol, and gels (LAGs) by airline passengers have been in place since November 2006, following the discovery of a terrorist plot involving homemade liquid explosives to be used on transatlantic flights (Wikipedia, 2006). Restrictions on the carriage of LAGs remain today, and the operational impact of introducing further screening of liquids is subject to ongoing debate. This paper addresses one of the concerns, namely that the false alarm rates of liquid explosive detection systems (LEDS) are adversely affected by the filling level of LAGs containers. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the operational impact of screening partially full containers, based on a large number of screening repetitions under laboratory conditions and robust statistical analysis. False alarm rates were observed for 39 LAGs screened with 5 different LEDS. For each combination, four different container filling levels (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%) were studied. These observations were used to model the impact of partially filling for sequential combinations of equipment. Three possible scenarios were considered, namely passengers being allowed to carry (1) only water, (2) water & soft drinks, and (3) all LAGs. The results show that, for a sequential combination of two equipment types, the impact of partially filled containers on the overall false alarm rate is negligible. Nevertheless, partially filled containers do result in an approximate two-fold increase in the number of items requiring level-two screening, which may be significant for airports when managing their screening processes. © 2017, The Auhtor(s).},

abstract={The heated scholarly and public debate on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has centred predominantly on two questions. Firstly, is there something particularly special about TTIP, other than the fact that it involves the world’s largest trading partners? And, secondly, is the concern about TTIP’s deleterious effects justified? The starting point for our argument is that understanding an agreement like TTIP requires an emphasis on the socially constructed nature of reality. TTIP is ultimately novel in terms of the regulatory scope of its provisions, and it is problematic because it subtly promotes the (socially constructed) interests of those who merely see regulation as inefficient ‘red tape’. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={De Ville and Siles-Brügge (2016) argue that the politics of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations are entirely new and that it will lead to ‘regulatory chill’. We think these two statements are untenable from a logical and empirical standpoint. While distributive political conflict is relatively absent because of firms’ integration into global value chains, civil society organizations voice value-based opposition to the prospective agreement, just like in the past. TTIP is also unlikely to undermine contracting parties’ ability to regulate the market to promote fundamental social values, because regulatory convergence is generally decided upon in a piece-meal fashion, and is subject to a super-majoritarian (dis)approval threshold in the Council, the European Parliament and national parliaments. Moreover, we show why it is plausible to expect TTIP to result in an upgrading of world trade rules, a benign development on the global level. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This contribution argues that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is unprecedented, not because it constitutes a Polanyian moment, but rather because it offers an alternative to multilateralism through the World Trade Organization (WTO). Never before has bilateralism offered such a ‘best alternative to no agreement’ (BATNA) to members of the core decision-making body of the WTO negotiating arm, making TTIP an unprecedented geopolitical game-changer. The anti-TTIP campaign, however, has not been driven by concerns with either geopolitics or trade liberalization, but rather fears about the European Union’s (EU’s) bargaining power. By strategically focusing on the potential impact on public policy and safety standards, normative arguments promulgated by opponents reflect concerns with perceived threats to the status quo and a willingness to preserve the same. The United States is presented (implicitly) as more powerful than the EU, and therefore perceived as able to impose its preferences, which are considered too neoliberal. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The ‘bloomers’ are rarely considered beyond their 1851 origins in the United States and subsequent appearance in Britain. This article expands dress reform scholarship by analysing print culture elsewhere in the British world, specifically Australia and New Zealand. The colonial press manufactured controversy over this fashion – a perceived transgression of gender norms – even though antipodean women rarely sported the outfit. This article focuses on the dress reform lectures and writings of Amelia Bloomer, Caroline Dexter and Dr Mary Walker. While certain continuities resurfaced alongside the bloomer-like rational dress popularised in the bicycling culture of the 1890s, dress reform was largely deemed far less controversial by the turn of the twentieth century. © 2017 The Social History Society},

abstract={This article examines a series of British travel documentaries on the American South made since 2008 which are representative of the way in which southern distinctiveness is maintained through television within a transatlantic context. The travelogues focus on historic racial struggles, southern food, and music, and frame the South as a distinctly historical space, where either historical moments obscure the contemporary South, or cultural continuity and resistance to change and modernity are celebrated. The article also discusses the similarities between the travelogues and the southern tourist industry, and how transatlantic “televisual tourism” works against the wider scholarly challenge to southern exceptionalism.

abstract={After World War II American and European Protestants linked up at various organisational levels to discuss and defend their common interests. On the American side this was far from a unified action. Disagreements between liberal and conservative Protestants in the United States meant that each side reached out to Europe in different ways, resulting in a variety of transatlantic religious alliances. The liberal representatives tried to draft a common platform for European engagement as part of their ecumenical objectives. Conservative Protestants on the other hand, feared this liberal effort and courted European souls with informal evangelical networks and joint US-European revival campaigns. Neither effort to shape new alliances was as successful as anticipated. Both suffered from Europe’s strong national religious interests and from the incongruity of a US presence in transatlantic political formations. As well, neither group could easily transcend the ideological divide created by the Cold War. In the end American evangelicals had greater success in drawing citizens on both continents in viable transatlantic relationships. Though the religious connections surfaced publicly only on occasion, they contributed to a lively transatlantic religious exchange. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={The essay discusses the transatlantic as well as the gendered perspectives on US American slavery in the works of two nineteenth-century German immigrant women writers, Therese Robinson (writing under the pseudonym Talvj, 1797–1870) and Mathilde Franziska Anneke (1817–1884). I will argue that German immigrant women were not only critical observers of the practice of slavery in the USA but they used antislavery discourses to negotiate German women’s efforts to assimilate to American culture. In nineteenth-century transatlantic culture, German immigrant women engaged in and commented upon intersecting discourses on antislavery, Americanization, and womanhood. With regard to discussions of gender, race, and slavery in nineteenth-century US American fiction, writings of German immigrant women or literary representations of German immigration to the USA have rarely been considered. This essay thus shows how fiction written by German immigrant women expands the scope of US American antislavery literature. Its discussion of two lesser known German immigrant women authors contributes to the research on German American literary culture and transatlantic women’s history. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article explores American stereotypes of France in the Progressive era by analysing the little-known visit of Count Robert de Montesquiou. The most famous dandy in fin-de-siècle Paris, Montesquiou arrived in 1903 to give a series of talks on literature. His visit, however, sparked a wave of hostility which reveals the role of gender, and particularly masculinity, in driving francophobia. At the same time, his ability to win an admiring audience attests to the appeal of France. The response to Montesquiou thus illuminates the negative and positive stereotypes which together made up American perspectives of France in this era. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={Although numerous regional (security) organisations have implemented UNS Cauthorised military operations, we do not yet know which considerations prevail in the decision to work through a particular organisation. This article introduces a framework consisting of a capacity, legitimacy and hegemony logic for explaining the selection of a regional organisation. The article takes a rational institutionalist approach, suggesting that analysis should primarily focus on the cost-benefit analyses of states. It applies the framework to NATO’s involvement in the Libya crisis (2011). Using insights from policy documents and 31 elite interviews, it shows that thoroughly explaining NATO’s involvement is only possible by taking into account all three logics. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This article explores how U.S. public diplomacy resources in Norway were mobilised in support of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program in the early 1950s. These efforts had two main objectives: to display U.S. commitment to allied security, and thus provide ‘psychological reassurance’, and, secondly, to mobilise popular support for increased defence spending by the Norwegian Government. The first ambition played well with local audiences. The second was more controversial, as it could be apprehended as meddling in domestic affairs. Close cooperation with local actors, a characteristic of U.S. public diplomacy in Norway at large, was therefore particularly important in this case. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={Martin Wagner’s contribution to planning thought and management during the Weimar Republic is widely known, but he recedes into obscurity afterwards. However, he maintained a tenacious intellectual activity in his American exile, conducting teaching-oriented research as Associate Professor of Planning at Harvard Graduate School of Design and prolonging these explorations until his passing in 1957. Working with students and other colleagues–most prominently Walter Gropius–Wagner devised comprehensive proposals for an alternative regional urbanization pattern that combined radical city-core renewal for conspicuous services and high-end residence with a massive suburbanization of middle- and working-class housing and industrial activities. This scheme exacerbated his earlier conceptions and simultaneously incorporated new inflections stemming from a critical engagement with contemporary debates in the US, which allow a better understanding of his German period and the transatlantic transfer of planning ideologies. At Harvard, Wagner reinforced the political-economic perspective of his work, following a contradictory imperative to secure the implementation of proposals by assimilating capital’s spatiality in design strategies. Taking the dynamics of profit-oriented urbanization to their logical conclusion, the American Wagner envisioned a dark albeit consistent ‘diagram’ of the potential reach of a stark capitalist approach to territorial restructuring, prefiguring major urban shifts in subsequent decades. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The practices of private or public sector involvement differ from an international perspective. The following discussion will explore funding practices in the US and Germany. In Germany, there is a long tradition of public sector involvement while the US is predominately driven by private sector funding. A comparison will help identify long-standing practices in Germany and how they might be adapted to the US context. In a manner similar to the previous chapter on policies and programs, findings in this chapter are discussed at federal US, state of Michigan and local municipal levels, and European Union, Germany, and local-level funding. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={After having spent several years in exile in Mexico during World War II, in 1949 German Jewish author Anna Seghers published two novellas set in the Caribbean during the time of transatlantic slavery. In this essay, through an investigation of the novella “Wiedereinführung der Sklaverei in Guadeloupe” (“The Reintroduction of Slavery in Guadeloupe”), I question what Seghers’s portrayal of differently gendered and raced characters says about her argument about revolutionary politics. In general, socialists have long been criticized for their tendency to downplay racism as simply a by-effect that would be eliminated with capitalism. In this regard, Seghers seems to differ; rather than overlooking or downplaying race, “The Reintroduction of Slavery in Guadeloupe” has indeed been praised for demonstrating cross-racial solidarity embodied in its white, mulatto, and black male protagonists. As an author who had been active in socialist political circles since the 1920s and who settled in the Soviet-occupied zone upon returning to Germany from exile in 1947, Seghers’s interest in minority struggles and postcolonial issues is not surprising. However, I find this claim to cross-racial solidarity in Seghers’s text problematic; I will demonstrate my intervention with the story’s representation of its female characters. I argue that while the dark-skinned black women of the story are portrayed positively as having revolutionary potential, white and mulatto women are depicted as apolitical, bourgeois, and merely inhibitions to their male partners’ political activity. By allowing her white and mulatto female characters this passivity, Seghers’s attempt at a postcolonial narrative that encourages readers in socialist East Germany to view their colonial legacy more critically ultimately fails, in part because of the binaries and borders she maintains between women. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The African American revolutionary poetry outfit and purported grandfathers of rap The Last Poets coined their name from Keorapetse Kgositsile's poem “Towards a Walk in the Sun”. This is relatively common knowledge. However, no sustained academic research has been conducted on this crucial exchange in diasporic studies. In this paper, I show how Kgositsile's poem in question harvested the rich oral, aural, and literary practices of his native Setswana, which in turn enabled The Last Poets to not only draw a name from Kgositsile's poetry, but also a language and poetic. This way, I demonstrate multivalent streams of influences between black South Africa and black America, as opposed to the current one-way exchange in scholarship that almost always presents black South Africans as emulators and mimickers of Afro-American culture. I expose how Kgositsile's poetry trans/figures both Afro-American literary and musical histories. Functioning within the framework of pan-Africanism, I uncover black music's transatlantic arch in Kgositsile's poetry, which unifies Africa, the Caribbean, and black America. I offer a deep analysis of that arch, and demonstrate its dynamic and complex networks which span generations and centuries, and continues to be generative till today. I focus particularly on the evolution of orality and aurality in black expressive cultures, understood as practices that express the black cultural continuum on both sides of the Atlantic. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The essay retrieves the complex and at times contradictory encounters of Moravian missionaries, a Protestant group from Saxony, with enslaved Africans. For my investigation, I will single out both groups’ contact in the early eighteenth-century Danish West Indies and Dutch Suriname. I claim that, in their mission-related contacts during this specific period, both groups would receive glimpses of secular possibilities for future societies which eventually would help bring changes to their own specific secular settings. For the enslaved Africans, it implied an insistence on freedom from the misanthropic institution of New World slavery; for the Germans, it implied a maturing of progressive ideas in regard to the still existing secular estates system. This could happen only because these first missionaries often operated with means that were not part of any official mission directives. I will demonstrate this with three aspects: the missionaries’ approach to literacy for the enslaved, their encouragement of the enslaved to verbal and even legal protest, and, probably the most empowering tool, their invalidation of white people’s assumed God-given superiority in the eyes of black people. The nexus of these three aspects very likely contributed to each group’s vision of a society-to-come, which, in turn, must have led more to an ideological insistence on the human right to freedom with all its different implications than has been noted so far in scholarship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The task of comparing social policies has focused primarily on quantifying the outputs, but leaves out an important factor for policy to be carried out, as is the quantification of the inputs. This paper focuses in the government effort to financing and implementing social policies. The goal is to present the results of the implementation of Social Policy Index+ (SPI+) in the United Kingdom and Chile from 2005 to 2012, establishing a transatlantic comparison of the inputs of social policy in two countries with a liberal welfare model. The research question is: Does SPI+ allows us to establish differentiation between countries that belong to the same welfare regime at different continents? To achieve this, the study uses the SPI+ as a tool for measuring and comparing transatlantic social policies. Through a comparative analysis of SPI+ results with a contextual description it is possible to confirm the consistency of the instrument for defining subgroups within specific welfare models, that also allows measure, classify and properly compare the two countries studied. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Transparency has been a central issue in the debate regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), especially on the side of the European Union (EU). The lack of transparency in the negotiating process has been one of the main criticisms of civil society organizations (CSOs). The European Commission (EC) has tried to gain support for the negotiations through various ‘transparency initiatives’. Nonetheless, criticism by CSOs with regard to TTIP in general and the lack of transparency in specific remained prevalent. In this article, we explain this gap between various transparency initiatives implemented by the EC in TTIP and the expectations on the side of European CSOs. We perform a content analysis of position papers on transparency produced by CSOs, mainly in response to a European Ombudsman consultation, complemented by a number of official documents and targeted interviews. We find that the gap between the TTIP transparency initiatives and the expectations of CSOs can be explained by different views on what constitutes legitimate trade governance, and the role of transparency, participation, and accountability herein. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={To increase transparency of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, the European Commission has reformed existing information sharing systems for trade policy. The Commission has moved from a strategy of providing transparency in the form of access to documents to one of access to information, geared specifically towards enhancing consumption of the available information. In both public and institutional transparency policy, the width of the target audience and the depth of the information have increased, and the manner of provision has shifted from reactive to proactive provision of information. As a result, the TTIP is now being coined as the most transparent trade negotiation ever in the EU’s history and a pilot project for transparency policy in future trade negotiations. The article adopts a supplycentred perspective to explain a transparency policy that goes beyond the legal minimum imposed by formal requirements. It relies on interview data of the changes brought about in inter-institutional relations since 2014, basic quantitative and qualitative analysis of document material, and a five-month participatory observation by the author in the secretariat of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={This article considers the marking of the centenary of British emancipation in 1933 and 1934 in two former slave-trading provincial port cities, Bristol and Liverpool. Nationally, this centenary was used by the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society to celebrate white abolition heroes and promote contemporary campaigns against ‘modern-day slavery’. However, in Bristol and Liverpool this picture was complicated by both cities’ particular historic involvements in transatlantic slavery and contemporary imperial and demographic contexts. Looking at ‘local’ dimensions to this ‘national’ commemorative occasion brings to the fore variations which emphasise the influence of civic identities, racial contestations and the distinctly imperial context of this memorial discourse seen through these interwar ports of empire. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was the first of the ‘Mega-FTAs’ to be signed. Had it been ratified, it would have created the world’s largest preferential trade area. The negotiators of the TPP aspired to create ‘a next-generation transformative agreement’ that would address a new trade agenda focused on regulatory coherence and business facilitation. The expectation was that this agenda would generate a 21st Century trade politics that would be less contentious, at least among business actors, than traditional negotiations on market access. Studies of another Mega-FTA under negotiation, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that has a similar agenda found unified business support for the agreement domestically and the emergence of transnational business coalitions in support of the agreement. Recent theorising on trade politics suggests, however, that global value chains (GVCs) that involve vertical intra-industry trade introduce ‘traditional’ distributional issues that will divide business interests domestically–and, in the case of GVCs organised on different geographical bases, internationally as well. This cleavage was evident in the TPP negotiations, unlike those for TTIP, as were other divisions among business–both domestically and across countries–over the sharing of existing rents and of new rents generated by regulatory harmonisation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article explores German-American war relief for Germany during First World War, concentrating on the period of American neutrality, 1914–17. Based on financial ledgers, meeting protocols and the publications of ethnic organisations, it shows how German-American charity served as a force of mobilisation on behalf of the old fatherland after August 1914 even as American public sentiments turned increasingly hostile towards Germany. The article nuances common notions of American humanitarianism during the period of neutrality and broadens our understanding of how German-Americans (and by extension, ethnic groups more generally) tried to balance political loyalty to their ‘hostland’ with emotional attachment to their ‘homeland’. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Between 2010 and 2012, Warwick's hull remains and associated artefacts were excavated and recorded. Built early in the 17th century, Warwick’s structure revealed a traditional shipbuilding style. Covered with two layers of planking and a layer of sheathing, the ship was purpose-built for extended transatlantic voyages. Not exceeding 200 tons, Warwick was an average-size vessel with sufficient burthen to bring supplies and passengers to the colonies and return with tobacco. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={This paper explores the social distance between local residents and African–Americans who have settled in Ghana since the 1960s. Data generated from in-depth interviews suggest the African–American expatriates felt their proximity to collective slave memory or particularly slavery heritage conferred on them certain rights to exclude local residents who are more susceptible to forgetting the past. By appropriating traces of the past, the African–American expatriates provide a range of tourism services, albeit to visitors they believed subscribed to socially constructed meanings elicited at slave sites. The study suggests explicit recognition of African–American expatriates in the levels of contestations that result from slavery-based heritage tourism. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Germany has become a geo-economic power since its unification in 1990. Its foreign policy agenda has been shaped by its economic interests and the role of its export sector. Nevertheless, Russian actions in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe combined with the accession of the Trump Administration in the United States and the rise of China have resulted in a transition in the foreign policy paradigm toward Germany as a shaping power and more of a geopolitical actor which has to balance its economic interests with the new strategic challenges of a newly unstable Europe. © Georgetown University and Berghahn Books.},

abstract={The conclusion of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) constitutes a priority and key component of the external trade policy of the European Union (EU). It is also an immediate follow-up to several years of regulatory cooperation between the two global trade powers. In an era of megaregionals, services is the only area where significant negotiating traction exists at the bilateral and multilateral level. However, recent events such as the imminent Brexit and the withdrawal of the USA from the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) cast doubt on the future of trade deals. Even so, services remain a key sector of export interest for the EU and thus completing agreements such as the TTIP or the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) is of crucial importance, allowing the EU to create new opportunities for service suppliers but also to reshape the regulatory philosophy governing the future regulation of global trade in services. With respect to TTIP, the EU Commission, backed by the EU executive, has advanced an ambitious agenda and submitted a conditional offer to the US, hoping for further liberalization on the two sides of the Atlantic. Against this backdrop, this article offers a critical account of the EU external trade policy, focusing on the EU's recent external action with respect to services liberalization. The article advances three theses: First, that such ambitious agreements mark a new era of offensive services strategy which, however, is contained by internal conflicts and disagreements regarding certain still sensitive silos such as audiovisual or public services and Brexit shall exacerbate such internal conflicts in the medium run; second, that megaregionals can be used to accelerate domestic regulatory reform and openness in the service sector; and third, that TiSA will constitute a litmus test for the EU's commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO) cause.

abstract={‘Civic Studies’ is a nascent field of research coming from the US, which is widely unknown in European academia, however it is a promising approach for research on representation and citizenship in the crisis-ridden EUrope of today. That today’s EUrope is far from being free of conflict is a fact that repeatedly provokes an outcry for a stronger EUropean community to overcome the ‘EUropean crisis’. I approach this interconnectedness of community and conflict in a different way, stating that conflict in and about EUrope has the potential to create a community of active European citizens – a new collective that I call the ‘European Civics’. In my research project, this ‘European Civics’ is engaged in a EUropean conflict that has been of topical public interest in the last years: the Anti-TTIP-protests. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Russia, cyberterrorism, Da’esh are among the most quoted challenges to NATO mentioned in the organizations’ documents, specialized literature and newspaper articles. How about a subtler, less striking but real challenge like demographic change? Demographic trends are increasingly recognized as relevant in understanding international politics and particularly international security, but only seldom taken into consideration when dealing with NATO’s future challenges. NATO, hence, suffers from the limits of a political–military institution designed for a post-Second World War demographic and security context that is changing drastically – and is expected to change even more in the foreseeable future. The aim of this article is to explore the current and projected demographic trends at the global level, evaluate their security implications and then draw inferences for the challenges and opportunities that will arise for NATO out of the sketched scenarios. Based on this analysis, we posit that the Alliance is facing a demographic paradox, whereby it is increasingly unable to cope with external demographic challenges because internal demographic changes are weakening the cohesion needed to provide an effective response. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={In EU trade policy literature it is common knowledge that EU member states can initiate, postpone and even block trade negotiations. Their importance therefore is of great significance but knowledge on member governments’ trade policy preferences is very limited. Main aim of this article is to close this research gap by calling for a stronger focus on the domestic politics towards EU trade policy-making by examining member governments’ trade policy preferences. Numerous trade negotiations have illustrated that these preferences can considerably diverge in cross-country comparison. The most recent example are the EU-U.S. trade negotiations. Why did governmental trade policy preferences towards the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) differ? Novel here is the application of the societal approach to governmental preference formation which primarily focuses on domestic-level variables, sectoral interests and value-based ideas, in shaping governmental trade positions. The relationship between these independent variables is examined in order to illustrate which of these was more dominant and under which conditions, in shaping British and German governmental trade policy preferences during TTIP negotiations. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has become a quintessential tool in administrative law informing a variety of modes of regulatory governance. It provides a justification for the regulation of markets based on a quasi-scientific and seemly neutral logic to assess the impact of secondary legislation by government agencies. A new frontier for CBA is the promotion of trade liberalization. It features prominently in the regulatory chapter of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). During the TTIP negotiations, scholars deployed CBA as a "neutral" tool to achieve greater convergence or reassert divergence and experimentalism in regulatory governance across the Atlantic. A genealogical examination reveals the existence of at least two strains of cost-benefit analyses in Western legal thought. The first one goes back to social orientations in private law translating into social-scientific expertise for regulators and proportionality for judges. The second one goes back to neoclassical economics in private law translating into economic-scientific expertise for regulators and balancing for judges. Today, scholars in their convergentist, divergentist, or experimentalist approaches to governance deploy CBA and regulatory science as a neutral and quasi-scientific method to legitimize the subjection of national regulation to more demanding standards. Instead, the genealogical approach reveals that CBA is a contingent and open-ended regulatory tool that justifies Contentious political decisions about regulatory strategies while allowing lawyers who apply CBA to remain agnostic on its distributive impact. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are an important issue in the negotiations between the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently underway. However, Geographical Indications (GIs) are one of the most disputed topics because, for decades, the US and the EU have each led one of two seemingly irreconcilable camps on how to address the protection of GIs at the international level. Agreeing on GIs protection in international trade raises important issues related to four dimensions of the GI system, which are likely to become ever more relevant as the TTIP negotiations proceed: i) legal and institutional protection; ii) domestic and international trade; iii) rural/local development and sustainability; and iv) consumers, quality and food safety. Although important, GIs represent only one of the many chapters of the TTIP, and it is in the nature of such agreements that the final text will be the outcome of numerous compromises. To date, the details of the negotiations in the public domain are scant and only in the next few months will we discover whether the protection of GIs in TTIP is a mission possible or will remain an illusory hope. © 2016 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE)},

The aim of this paper is to introduce the cooperative and complementary ANL-JRC activities focusing on chassis dynamometer testing of electrified vehicles. Within this research program, financed by the budgets of the Transatlantic Interoperability Centers at ANL and JRC, an extensively instrumented 2014 BMW i3 plug-in electric vehicle equipped with a range extending engine (REX), was evaluated at both the ANL's Advanced Powertrain Research Facility (APRF), and at the JRC's Vehicle electric Laboratory (VeLA 8). Testing was conducted against EU and US legislative cycles, in addition to operation-specific cycles with the vehicle conditioned and operating at varying ambient conditions from -30°C to 50°C. Data analysis focuses on both vehicle- and component-specific energy use across these varying temperatures and power demands. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The transatlantic Islamophobia industry, emboldened by US intelligence efforts to entrap Muslims, appears to have helped to increase permissible levels of Islamophobia across the US, as illustrated by the fiery anti-Muslim rhetoric during the 2016 presidential campaign. In this article, I first look at five key leaders of the Islamophobia industry who also claim to be “terrorism experts” and have links to US and Israeli intelligence. I then describe US law enforcement’s mass surveillance of Muslims and its invention of terrorists, including a map of the “successful terrorist prosecutions” claimed by the US Department of Justice, most of which were tried only as criminal cases. Finally, I explore in-depth the case against the Holy Land Foundation, a Muslim charity based in Texas that was run by Palestinian-Americans and targeted by both the state and the Islamophobia industry for its dubious links to “terrorism”, helping to legitimate the Bush W. Administration’s “War on Terror”. I argue that this nexus of intelligence and Islamophobia has empowered anti-Muslim voices that were formerly marginal. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={This book explores the Pakistani diaspora in a transatlantic context, enquiring into the ways in which young first- and second-generation Pakistani Muslim and non-Muslim men resist hegemonic identity narratives and respond to their marginalised conditions. Drawing on rich documentary, ethnographic and interview material gathered in Boston and Dublin, Islam, Race, and Pluralism in the Pakistani Diaspora introduces the term 'Pakphobia', a dividing line that is set up to define the places that are safe and to distinguish 'us' and 'them' in a Pakistani diasporic context. With a multiple case study design, which accounts for the heterogeneity of Pakistani populations, the author explores the language of fear and how this fear has given rise to a 'politics of fear' whose aim is to distract and divide communities. A rich, cross-national study of one of the largest minority groups in the US and Western Europe, this book will appeal to sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and geographers with interests in race and ethnicity, migration and diasporic communities. © 2018 Craig Considine.

abstract={Transatlantic burden-sharing debates often centre on defence expenditures and participation in missions out-of-area. An analysis of US strategy for cooperation with Nordic and Baltic countries during the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies reveals how the United States has worked to promote security export much more broadly. It pursued contributions through in-area military installations, military partnership and missions, and political/economic cooperation promoting security and stability in Northern Europe, the Euro-Atlantic area, and far away. Global strategies and specific thinking regarding contributions from this region formed US policies. Developments were not linear; the United States took on commitments, even as it promoted increased burden-sharing. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={In the late nineteenth century European intellectual circles participated in a debate on the possible confrontation between two so-called civilisations, represented respectively by Latin and Anglo-Saxon nations. The controversy moved to Latin America, where discussions showed certain peculiarities. Given the position occupied by Spanish intellectuals as links between Europe and the Western Hemisphere, this article seeks to emphasise how some prestigious Spanish publications dealt with the debate on race from 1898 to 1914. While the collaboration of foreign personalities and the publication of book reviews fostered the knowledge of this issue in Spain, one of the most important initiatives were the sections entitled ‘Review of Reviews’, which began to collect articles from other countries. The author takes as his object of study an important intellectual debate that transcended national borders and generated numerous reactions in both Europe and Latin America. This research demonstrates how the analysis of the Spanish press sheds light on the establishment of a circuit of opinions among foreign intellectuals. It not only allows to include Spain within a shared awareness network comprising European and Latin American nations, but also examines its special features within the transatlantic scenario. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={In early 1960s Canada one question dominated political debate and discourse in the areas of foreign and security policy–whether or not Canadian armed forces would adopt nuclear weapon roles in North America and Europe. By focusing mainly on groups and individuals within civil society, the following analysis portrays a deeply divided Canada. On the one hand, supporters of liberal internationalism believed that acquiring nuclear weapons would make Canada a less effective and influential international actor and make nuclear war more likely, while on the other hand, conservative internationalists took the opposite position–that by assuming nuclear roles Canada’s international influence and effectiveness would increase and nuclear war would be less likely. In other words, the nuclear acquisition debate exposed deep divisions in Canadian society between those who viewed their country as either a ‘soft’ or a ‘hard’ middle power. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This article examines the role the Moscow–Washington Hotline played in the 1967 Six-Day War, focusing on the Soviet side. We argue that the Soviet Union used the Direct Communication Link much more broadly than had been intended when the Hotline was agreed on in 1963 mainly because Moscow did not assign the Hotline any special diplomatic significance. We also show that the Hotline is a poor channel for crisis negotiations, and its efficacy as a communication tool is compromised if regular diplomatic channels cannot match its speed. Finally, we challenge the existing debate in the historiography of the Six-Day War, arguing for the importance of studying the implications of Soviet behaviour rather than Soviet intentions. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={One bust and one statue located in close distance to each other in the centre of Bilbao ‒ the bust being that of the second President of the United States, John Adams, the statue that of José Antonio Aguirre, the first democratically elected first minister (lehendakari) of the Basque Country ‒ are visual representations not only of two charismatic statesmen and patriots but also reminders of what it practically entails to fight for independence and the survival of new polities under difficult circumstances. This paper does three things. First, it establishes the historical nexus between the two figures in terms of a rarely discussed transatlantic intellectual undercurrent, which stretches for a time period of roughly one and a half centuries from the American Revolution to the fall of Bilbao in the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of the Basque government in exile. Second, it discusses various aspects of the charismatic leadership of the two distinguished leaders which the two monuments and their proximity might evoke. Third, it points to the contemporary symbolic struggle for remembrance, particularly in the context of Bilbao’s urban renewal and the Basque Country’s attempt to define the modern political contours of its raison d’être. © 2017 International Visual Sociology Association.},

abstract={This paper brings together histories of race, both in the United States and in South Africa, in order to think about how slavery, segregation, and apartheid, as well as responses to these, have shaped ideas about national identity and belonging. In it I explore the ways these two histories of racial oppression–both slavery and segregation in the US, as well as segregation and apartheid in South Africa–share not only common and overlapping discursive histories, but can be seen as part of larger transatlantic dialogs on race, racial governance, and the boundaries of national belonging. The paper attempts to chart a history of exchange, between South Africa and the US, of ideas on racial policy and race thinking. This different genealogy for crossing the Atlantic will offer ways to think together events such as the shootings in Ferguson in the US and the shooting of miners at Marikana in South Africa, as related instances of how race–as defining feature of neoliberalism–continues to function in both places. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Mangroves emerged a crucial habitat for Africans and their descendants during the transatlantic slave trade. Europeans avoided mangroves because of the deadly fevers that frequently claimed the lives of those who ventured there. Many were felled by lethal falciparum malaria, against which Africans alone carried genetic resistance. The transatlantic slave trade spread the disease-causing plasmodium to New World Anopheles mosquitoes through infected bloodstreams, extending African mangroves’ pestilential reputation to the Neotropics. On both sides of the Atlantic, an environment Europeans feared provided Africans food, basic necessities, and sometimes, refuge from slavery. In Neotropical mangroves Africans largely replaced declining Amerindian populations, who were also immunologically vulnerable to the introduced plasmodium. Today, African descendants in Old and New World mangroves demonstrate longstanding human use of this ecosystem. Comparison of shellfish gathering and gendered collection patterns in mangroves recognizes Amerindian and African influences in Neotropical mangroves and illuminates the connections to transatlantic diasporic history. The discussion considers how a more-than-human geography shaped “place-based knowledge” of mangrove swamplands that remained marginal to European territorializing during the colonial period. African and Afro-descendant place-making underscores the ways people, plants, insects, microbes, shellfish, and tides framed geography and diasporic identity at the periphery of the Atlantic world.

abstract={For two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, globalization functioned as a unifying force in the West. In the absence of a common security threat, the United States and Europe found common ground in a neoliberal agenda calling for the freer movements of capital, goods, services, and peoples across national boundaries. Today, support for that neoliberal agenda has been rapidly weakening across the West. Drawing on a variety of quantitative measures, we show that Western support for globalization has declined, both at the level of national policy and at the level of party politics. We argue that this erosion of domestic support for globalization is closely linked to the rise of populist parties in Europe and the USA. We consider the implications of this shift in the West's domestic politics for the future of transatlantic cooperation and leadership. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={This Article is based on a larger work that seeks to map the uses of different legal vocabularies by ambitious European legal and political thinkers in the period of c. 1300-1800 in order to defend, explain and organize the exercise of power outside the domestic commonwealth. The Article examines the ways in which English legal languages (civil law, common law, natural law, jus gentium) were used to think about, propagate and defend English transatlantic expansion. For most of that time, in their relations public and private power remained closely interwoven. The pluralism of English law also contributed to the appearance of arguments from property and sovereignty in different configurations so that it is often hard to figure out which precise connotation is being made. The uses also varied significantly from Continental practices. I am above all interested in the imperial or colonial significance of these arguments. The point that emerges here is that by 1800, a conception of British Empire had arisen where the exercise of sovereign power was clearly derivative from and supplementary to claims about private property.},

abstract={This article analyzes the European crisis and the reconfiguration of neoliberal governance in light of efforts to deepen integration via what European Union President Manuel Barroso (2010) called a ‘Silent Revolution’ to create a new ‘economic government’ that could better manage crises and shape development alternatives. The article places recent developments in a longer-term perspective involving post-Second World War geopolitics, transatlantic class formations, extension of the world market and recent, fundamental crises of capitalism. It argues that in the current situation, the relative unity of Europe’s ruling classes contrasts with the relative fragmentation of subaltern forces, mainly along national-popular lines. This situation shapes (but does not necessarily determine) the ‘limits of the possible’ for political agency in Europe, and it helps explain the persistence of neoliberalism in the European Union in a situation of organic crisis, where the relations of force remain contested, open and politically unstable. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={This article sheds light on a covert counterterrorist deal between the Western European and Israeli security services, which was concluded in 1971 under the auspices of the Swiss government. This security arrangement was held under the framework of the Club de Berne, an informal forum of nine Western security services and their transatlantic and Middle Eastern partners. Based on hitherto unknown source material, the article discusses four main aspects of the Club de Berne: its creation, its background within the Swiss administration (complete lack of democratic oversight, absolute secrecy and neutrality), its threat warning system under the code word Kilowatt and the reasons for the participating countries to choose cooperation within this network. The main argument is that the Club de Berne was a security arrangement beneficial to all parties: it allowed Europeans to protect themselves from Palestinian terrorism without being seen as helping Israel; this secret dimension was also what allowed ‘neutral’ Switzerland to take part in this security framework. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Research on the circulation of artworks between Europe and the Americas superficially examined the role played by Portugal-based individuals in the trade of looted art in the immediate postwar period. Since then, however, cultural studies have ignored the interactions between Portuguese museums and collectors, and refugees and expatriates involved in the trade, as well as the role played by Portugal in the transatlantic circulation of artworks. This article has two goals: first, to examine the lack of academic engagement in the study of the transactions and provenance of artworks in Portugal between 1933 and 1945; second, to ascertain the existence and demonstrate the utility of Portuguese sources in conducting this study, by focusing on what they reveal about art dealer Karl Buchholz. Through an outline of the main areas of research, this article discusses Portuguese academic practice and museum practice. It identifies and contextualizes biases and opens the door for academic attention to Nazi-era provenance research. Portuguese sources illustrating the activity of Karl Buchholz in Portugal between 1943–5 enable a reconstruction of the chronology of his exhibitions in Lisbon and a partial identification of the artworks exhibited. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The recent debate about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has triggered widespread opposition to the trade agreement in Germany. It is not clear, however, what factors drive public attitudes toward transatlantic trade. This article explores the role of anti-Americanism in predicting attitudes toward TTIP among the German public. It argues that the impact of anti-Americanism depends on the extent to which political elites frame the TTIP proposal as a basic conflict between American and European values. Using data from two national representative surveys, it is found that attitudes toward America strongly predict support for the TTIP agreement. The results further demonstrate that the effect of national resentment is moderated by issue awareness, with citizens with a strong anti-American sentiment being significantly more likely to oppose the agreement if they follow the elite debate more closely. Taken together, the results suggest that national resentments are more important for the explanation of TTIP preferences than traditional factors such as partisanship, ideology and material concerns. © 2017 Association for the Study of German Politics},

abstract={The paper addresses the complexity of social issues in contemporary American society through the prism of its reflection in theatre and literature. The characteristic features of American narratives and performatives are freedom and an almost utopian belief in diversity and social understanding. At the same time, the discussed works present a comprehensive look at social issues using a great variety of forms and genres, and appealing to the aesthetic sensitivity of different groups of recipients. In the face of future problems in the political arena, American art offers an interesting transatlantic perspective on the complexity of 21st-century issues which are relevant all over the world. © 2017 Alim.},

abstract={Extending the work of The Routledge Handbook to Nineteenth-Century British Periodicals and Newspapers, this volume provides a critical introduction and case studies that illustrate cutting-edge approaches to periodicals research, as well as an overview of recent developments in the field. The twelve chapters model diverse approaches and methodologies for research on nineteenth-century periodicals. Each case study is contextualized within one of the following broad areas of research: single periodicals, individual journalists, gender issues, periodical networks, genre, the relationship between periodicals, transnational/transatlantic connections, technologies of printing and illustration, links within a single periodical, topical subjects, science and periodicals, and imperialism and periodicals. Contributors incorporate first-person accounts of how they conducted their research and provide specific examples of how they gained access to primary sources, as well as the methods they used to analyze the materials. © 2018 Alexis Easley, Andrew King, and John Morton.

abstract={This book considers institutional racism as a problem that exists within modern societies. Its roots lie with the transatlantic slave trade and slavery and the solution involves ridding society of the problem. It is argued here that, first, there needs to be an acceptance of its existence, then developing the tools needed to deal with it and, finally, to implement those tools so that institutional racism can be permanently removed from society. The book has four themes: the first considers the nature of institutional racism, the second theme looks at instances of institutional racism through matters such as deaths in custody and skin lightening, the third considers the concept of reparations and the final area looks at the development of social movements as a way of pushing institutional racism up the political agenda. The development of a social movement is part of a social discourse which would, for example, push mentoring as a form of reparations. There is a need for more research on the manifestations of institutional racism and this book is part of that discourse. It is argued that the legacy of the slave trade and slavery is continuing and contemporary through the presence of institutional racism in society. This problem has not been addressed through legislation and policies devised to combat racial discrimination. Institutional racism needs to be understood as being located in the processes and procedures of societal institutions. © 2017 Fernne Brennan. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent decades, our perception of borders has become increasingly complex: 30 years after the Schengen Agreement, EU citizens’ freedom to travel is largely taken for granted, yet contemporary debates on refugees and the external borders of the European Union suggest that borders resemble semi-permeable membranes, enabling the influx of “desired” persons while excluding “undesirable” migratory flows. However, these trends in “filtering” movements of people are hardly unique to the 21st century. This article treats the Ruhr Valley as an example of early migration to Germany and the associated rights and restrictions placed on movement there in the second half of the “long” 19th century. The author argues that limits on migration and settlement also shifted in zones of increasing mobility and migration like the Ruhr region, where they excluded Russian “Poles” in particular. However, migration control by the higher authorities was never total. The paper first shows how the actions of different groups (political authorities, entrepreneurs, migrants, and their networks) were intertwined with one another in a way that made the Ruhr region into a preferred destination for migrants within a transatlantic migration system. It then critically analyzes the hitherto little discussed expulsions and naturalization procedures as political means of population control and illuminates the importance of latent divergent interests at different levels of government. Overall, the study intends to contribute to a better understanding of the different social mechanisms on the local level that were part of migration control in the context of the nascent (nation) state. © 2017 Association for Borderlands Studies},

abstract={This article aims at challenging the notion of a French exception in the realm of irregular warfare, suggesting that it rather amounts to a western variation. Born out of a transatlantic community under British influence, the French irregular experience carried on through the early Cold War challenges, strengthening France’s ties with its Western allies. France’s subsequent involvement in post-colonial counter-insurgencies did contribute to generating some specific strategic features, although never totally disconnected from international circulation. Finally, the post-Cold War order significantly drove French irregular warfare back into its Western fold through the adoption of US- and NATO-sponsored concepts and doctrines, thus enhancing interoperability and some degree of standardisation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The failed expedition of Suez in 1956 and France’s subsequent strategic ‘divorce’ from the United Kingdom and the United States lies at the heart of a policy paradigm that has dictated France’s defence posture from de Gaulle’s presidency to the end of the Cold War. Some crucial features of the Gaullist posture remain today enduring references for French presidents in the definition of France’s exceptionalism. While it is so, there have been significant changes since the 1990s when it comes to France’s strategic relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. This article demonstrates the extent and mechanisms of this rapprochement by analysing it through three dimensions of policy change: modes of action, institutional commitments and discourses. The article demonstrates the dimensions’ mutually reinforcing effects and argues that France’s exceptional posture has de facto been reversed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This essay examines and evaluates China’s global rise and the state of the transatlantic discussions about this issue. Since 2010, the rise of China has been accompanied by multiple Chinese initiatives on the international front, especially in the fields of trade and investment. Chinese overseas direct investments are on the rise at a global level. The creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, of the Silk Road Fund, and of the “Belt and Road” initiative are signs of a much more assertive China that is now engaging Western countries, including Europe and the USA. Western reactions, both at governmental and grass-root levels have been mixed. Two questions emerge: can Europeans agree on a common policy toward China? And can the USA and the European Union pursue a dialog and a more coordinated strategy? This will be especially relevant in the context of President Donald Trump’s administration as well as newly elected governments in France and Germany following general elections in these countries in 2017. The future of a transatlantic dialog should also encompass the British question when the UK leaves the EU. As the USA and leading European countries map their foreign policy strategies in coming years, there is a need to elevate policy coordination toward China in the hierarchy of political and economic goals. The paper offers some suggestions on possible priorities. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This chapter argues that in the case of the EU’s efforts to undertake a “Pivot to Asia”, added explanatory salience can be achieved by recognising firstly the importance of the transatlantic factor and the US’ own rebalance policies. Secondly, based on a model where the USA is regarded as a significant variable in the EU-China relationship, one may more saliently discern the influence of Russia by assessing its impact on the triangular EU-China-US relationship, both directly and indirectly. Addressing these issues in European policymaking, the chapter will be constituted of two main parts. In the first section, the triangular nature of European foreign policies towards China is introduced, addressing the transatlantic factor in EU-China relations. Based on research on the European policy debates on EU’s Asia policies and the American Pivot to Asia, the section will illustrate the degree to which EU policy initiatives are conceived as playing out on a range from cooperation to competition with the US’ rebalance initiatives. In the second section, the chapter will proceed to investigate a factor that is affecting, although to different degrees, all three corners of the triangular political context in which European China policies are being shaped, namely the effects of recent Russian actions in the Eurasian theatre. The analysis demonstrates how European policymakers struggle to define their place in the EU-China-US triangle. The dynamics of the ongoing Asian power shift highlights the dilemmas for the European continent, as it seeks to balance its relations in a shifting geopolitical landscape. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Perceptions of the United States in European public opinion greatly improved around 2008, while perceptions of China simultaneously deteriorated. The Transatlantic and Sino-European relationships stem from radically different historical contexts. Yet could the image of China and the image of the U.S. be related in the eyes of Europeans? This paper examines whether attitudes toward China have contributed to determining attitudes toward the U.S. in Europe by analyzing data from the Transatlantic Trends survey taken in 2010, a critical juncture in Europe's relations with both the U.S. and China. We investigate three hypotheses about this relation: The "yin and yank" or negative correlation (the more Europeans fear China, the more positive they become about the U.S.; the more favorably Europeans view China, the more negatively they see the U.S.); the "open vs. closed" or positive correlation (the more favorably Europeans see China, the more favorably they see the U.S.; the more negatively they see China, the more negatively they see the U.S.); and no relation (European attitudes toward China and the U.S. are independent). To the question of whether anti-Chinese sentiment has the potential for replacing anti-Americanism in Europe, our main conclusion is that positively correlated attitudes toward the U.S. and China reveal a deep cleavage in Europe between those who are "in" and those who are "out" of globalization. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={This article argues for the necessity, for white scholars, to turn to the study of what I call enslavism, a term necessary to situate current anti-Black practices in the "future that had been created by men and women in chains" (Hartman, Saidiya V. [2007]. Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route. New York, NY: Farrar, 233) and thus to critique them as the ongoing afterlife of enslavement, instead of addressing slavery as an event in bygone history. Conceptualizing their work with this term, white scholars may labor to contribute to Black Studies by way of "sitting with" (see Sharpe, Christina [2016]. In the Wake: On Blackness and Being. Durham, NC: Duke University Press) black knowledge which can enable us to produce a critical protocol, to paraphrase Hortense Spillers, of enslavism as the ongoing afterlife of social, cultural and political anti-Blackness in the future that transatlantic enslavement has made. To produce those critical protocols means to re-read the longue durée of humanism in a way that abolishes the human's ontological reign of life, and of knowledge, based as it has been on black non-existence for the human. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={The consolidation of the counter genre that is long-form sports journalism (LFSJ) is of growing interest to the sports media researcher. In order to trace its expansion across the sports journalism landscape, this article offers a comparative transatlantic case study featuring the entire collection of long-form stories developed by two prestigious publications: the American magazine Sports Illustrated (SI Longform) and the French sports daily L’Équipe (L’Équipe Explore). The study considers the slow journalism heritage of LFSJ and its challenge to established Web interface theology while exploring key issues such as the sports agenda, sourcing and the use of immersive multimedia formats, aimed at improving the sporting culture of its users.

abstract={What was life really like for the band of adventurers who first set foot on the banks of the James River in 1607? Important as the accomplishments of these men and women were, the written records pertaining to them are scarce, ambiguous, and often conflicting, and those curious about the birthplace of the United States have had little to turn to except dramatic and often highly fictionalized reports. In Jamestown, the Truth Revealed, William Kelso takes us literally to the soil where the Jamestown colony began, unearthing footprints of a series of structures, beginning with the James Fort, to reveal fascinating evidence of the lives and deaths of the first settlers, of their endeavors and struggles, and new insight into their relationships with the Virginia Indians. He offers up a lively but fact-based account, framed around a narrative of the archaeological team's exciting discoveries. Unpersuaded by the common assumption that James Fort had long ago been washed away by the James River, William Kelso and his collaborators estimated the likely site for the fort and began to discover its extensive remains, including palisade walls, bulwarks, interior buildings, a well, a warehouse, and several pits. More than 2,000,000 objects were cataloged, more than half dating to the time of Queen Elizabeth and King James. In the time since that major find, roughly coinciding with Jamestown's quadricentennial, Kelso and his team have made several critical discoveries. He describes the recent excavations of numerous additional buildings, including the settlement's first church, which served as the burial place of four Jamestown leaders, the governor's row house during the term of Samuel Argall, and substantial dump sites, which are troves for archaeologists. He also recounts how researchers confirmed the practice of survival cannibalism in the colony following the recovery from an abandoned cellar bakery of the cleaver-scarred remains of a young English girl. CT scanning and computer graphics have even allowed researchers to put a face on this victim of the brutal winter of 1609-10, a period that has come to be known as the "starving time." Refuting the now decades-old stereotype that attributed the high mortality rate of the Jamestown settlers to their laziness and ineptitude, Jamestown, the Truth Revealed produces a vivid picture of the settlement that is far more complex, incorporating the most recent archaeology and using twenty-first-century technology to give Jamestown its rightful place in history and thus contributing to a broader understanding of the transatlantic world. © 2017 William M.

abstract={SUMMARY: This article analyses the making of space in modern parliamentarism from a transatlantic perspective. By considering the case studies of New Granada and Spain between 1810 and 1831, this article focuses on the differences in shaping parliamentary space during the revolutionary period in Europe and the Americas. This study considers the multiplicity of spaces in the construction of parliaments as modern institutions. It also discusses the influences of early modern estate parliaments in the construction of new institutional space in revolutionary times. In the process, several elements will be considered, such as the choice of the town where parliaments convene and the internal organization of the assembly hall. It is argued that, despite similar issues beyond the construction of a new institution, the influence of the king’s presence in Spain led to a different shape of internal parliamentary space compared to New Granada. Such an approach makes an original contribution to the debates on the transformation of sovereignty during this period and it therefore reshapes the interpretation of the revolutionary process from a cultural perspective. © 2017 International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions/Commission Internationale pour l’Histoire des Assemblées d’ États.},

abstract={David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage is now two centuries old, but it remains at the heart of economists’ theories of international trade. It also continues to provide the underlying economic ethic for liberal International Political Economy (IPE). Ricardo’s numerical illustration of the mutually shared gains from specialisation and trade involved complementary structures of comparative advantage being exhibited by a productively superior hypothetical ‘Portugal’ and a productively inferior hypothetical ‘England’. Yet, the historical back-story of actual eighteenth-century trading relations between the two countries reveals Portugal’s repeated struggles to meet its treaty obligations to the English in the context of the European quest for empire. Those difficulties persisted even when it harnessed its (less profitable) commercial trade to (much more profitable) slave trading practices. Ricardo’s account of the purely mathematical logic of comparative advantage writes out of economic history the centrality of both imperial wars and African slavery to the early English and Portuguese experience of ‘free’ trade. Given this historical back-story, liberal IPE thus appears to be in urgent need of new normative foundations to decouple it from these highly illiberal economic processes. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Tourism in Paris embodies the contradictions of contemporary France, which struggles to think critically about its own postcolonial era. The invisibilization of colonial and anticolonial traces in the production of Parisian tourism narratives, the heightened otherness of Black communities in the tourist offer and the complex institutional heritagization of the colonial past illustrate the challenges in thinking about racial difference. By articulating two bodies of work, one dealing with racialization processes in French society, and the other with the geography and anthropology of tourism, this article examines the modalities in which a counter-hegemonic narrative of Parisian and French identity is produced and received based on the analysis of a tourism project, Le Paris Noir, or Black Paris. The article casts light on the symbolic violence that occurs through the internalization of the invisibilization of Black geographies and the challenges in breaking with France's powerful assimilationist legacy among racialized minorities. The Black Paris project serves as a laboratory to observe the effects of the racial denial mechanisms occurring in French society, and the resistance to them, taking the form of a decolonial praxis. The article emphasizes the role of social technologies in shaping the relational narrative of a transatlantic Blackness. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper aims to study notable examples of transatlantic transmissions of norms, beliefs and values that have revised the sense of a Luso-Brazilian community in a global world. The so-called Atlantic Civilization understood before as essentially Anglo-Saxon, takes a new shape when seen by the South Atlantic. If the historical relationship between Portugal and Brazil was one of colonial containment, since the nineteenth century those bilateral relations have passed through a process of reconciliation and networking–first through a mutual acceptance, then through the establishment of common international goals. On the one hand, this networking between Portugal and Brazil has occurred through public symbolic demonstration and the commemoration of a common culture; on the other hand, this networking has evolved through cultural connections–music, literature, and cinema,–all of which serve to validate a postcolonial review. Cultural connections that have survived the proverbial test of time have proven to be valuable in assessing the evolving relationship between Portugal and Brazil. Therefore, the Brazilian conscientiousness of its importance in the regional and world sphere involved the preparation of a Brazilian cultural diplomacy that recognized the political desire of diplomacy between Portugal and Brazil–a diplomacy that is largely demonstrative of the importance of soft power in a world of global networks. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Access to and diffusion of information relating to the Terrorism Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) has become a focal point for discussions about secrecy and democracy in the European Union. This paper analyses the dynamics of secrecy and publicity in the context of post-9/11 security programmes, in particular, the TFTP. Far from a binary between secrecy and transparency, the TFTP involves complex dynamics of knowledge, and strictly regulated information distribution. The purpose of the article is threefold. First, we contribute to debates on EU secrecy and democratic oversight, by advancing an understanding of secrecy as practice. Second, we document and discuss the longer trajectory of the contested secrecy and publicity of the TFTP, through examining three ‘secrecy controversies’. Third, we ask whether the logics of secrecy in the EU are being revised and challenged in the context of transatlantic security cooperation. The rationales of secrecy deployed in security practice hinge on particular notions of potential future harm that, we argue, are shifting in the face of current understandings of the terrorist threat. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In a recent collection of essays assessing the thought of William James in transatlantic perspective, Berkeley historian emeritus David Hollinger opened his contribution by recounting two memorable exchanges: The sermon at William James's funeral on 30 August 1910 was preached by the Reverend George A. Gordon, a name recognized today only by religious history specialists, but in 1910 a pulpiteer so prominent that he was sometimes described as “the Matterhorn of the Protestant Alps” . . . Gordon, a close friend of James, was the minister of Boston's Old South Congregational Church. When the great philosopher died on 26 August, his widow immediately selected Gordon to perform the service. Mrs. James made clear to Gordon why she wanted him. You are “a man of faith,” which “is what [William] was.” About this she was firm, apprising Gordon that she wanted at this funeral service “no hesitation or diluted utterance” in speaking about faith. Mrs. James had good reason to say these things. Her late husband had been candid about his feelings of spiritual solidarity with Gordon. “You and I seem to be working . . . towards the same end (the Kingdom of Heaven, namely),” James had written to his clergyman friend not long before, although [he claimed Gordon did] this “more openly and immediately” than [he did].

abstract={This article assesses President Obama’s transatlantic leadership style with regard to foreign crises and it contrasts it with the style of the previous Bush administration. It argues that the Obama administration exercises what we call enabling leadership, which implies that the US does lead, but that it does not feel the need to project ‘leadership from the front’. The article first analyses the diplomatic aspect of leadership by focusing on the ‘speaking order’ among the United States and three of its core allies, namely the United Kingdom, France and Canada. It presents a computer-assisted content analysis of the 482 official statements issued by these four states in response to the crisis in Libya in 2011 and Mali in 2012–2013. The paper then performs a detailed analysis of the financial and military contributions of the US and its allies to confront these crises. It provides qualitative and quantitative evidence suggesting that the Obama administration consciously adopted enabling leadership, a strategy that is consistent with the worldview of the president and his foreign policy entourage. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This paper offers a transatlantic comparison of shale politics. Both the US and European Union (EU) have ample shale beds; both are high consumption democracies thirsty for plentiful, stable, cheaper sources of energy. Yet exploitation of shale in the US has proceeded at fever pitch, while in the EU development has been hesitant if not stagnant. Structural explanations – geological, geographic, economic, technological – are key to understanding this difference, but so too is the role of agency – who are the actors shaping policy and how do they seek to influence public debate and government agendas? This study, while mindful of structural conditions, applies insights from network and framing analysis to highlight the set of actors, interests and frames that shape shale’s variable development in the US and Europe. Drawing on an in-depth, systematic analysis of news reports, websites and interviews from 2013 to 2015, it demonstrates how differences in shale policy are explained not just by geology, economic or other structural factors, but also by the role of competing pro- and anti-shale networks, and the framing strategies they enjoy. In short, it argues that the interaction of structure and agency best explains transatlantic differences. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This paper explores a paradox. On the one hand it is believed that 9/11 rekindled the UK–US special relationship, but at the same time it has been argued that British mismanagement of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan caused relations to deteriorate. Whilst I agree with part of this analysis in that Iraq represented a nadir in Anglo American relations I believe Afghanistan did not follow this trajectory. A wide range of factors help to explain this change in fortune, but I focus on the role played by the British military in restoring the trust and confidence of its US counterpart and argue that this institutional relationship was and is a vital component in the Anglo American Alliance. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={While recent work has attempted to update the research agenda for transatiantic defense burden-sharing, there remain significant gaps between the public choice defense economics literature and the security studies literature. The presence of such a gap is unfortunate, because defense spending choices are likely shaped by factors identified by the public choice literature, as well as the strategic and cultural variables that the security studies literature tends to focus on, as well as domestic macroeconomic factors. The independent variables identified in recent qualitative literature are extremely useful analytically, and, fortunately, they have reasonable proxies in available quantitative data, which enables scholars to study them across large groups of countries and many years. This article builds upon such work to synthesize the most notable of the factors identified in the current literature, and offers some common analytical ground that will benefit both scholars and practitioners. © Informa UK Limited.},

abstract={After the long domination of economic and collective action theories, the literature on the political aspects of Allied burden-sharing is growing. This article analyses the politics of fair-share in NATO from the perspective of Canadian officials during the first burden-sharing debates in 1949–1952. I focus on sense-making and, through an interpretive methodology, I reconstruct the Canadian discourse on fair-share. This article shows that for Canada sharing NATO’s burden was not only a matter of technicality or realist considerations; in order to make NATO burden-sharing work, the allies needed to balance three dimensions of collective defence burden: military, economic, and moral. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This article aims to analyse the role played by the USA and the European Union (EU) in Middle East peacemaking. It argues that there exists a de facto division of labour between two actors. While the USA has played a primary role and acted as the principal mediator in successive mediation efforts and dominated political and diplomatic dimension of the peace process; the EU was relegated to a secondary and supplementary role and has mainly focused on economic and financial dimension of the peace process and the creation of the structural conditions for sustainable peace which aimed to complement peacemaking efforts at the diplomatic level. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={In the late afternoon of Saturday 22 April 1848, the British cruiser H.M.S. Grecian gave chase to a suspicious-looking ship it encountered off the coast of Bahia, Brazil. By midnight, the Grecian succeeded in seizing the slave ship Bella Miquelina. One week later, the Bella Miquelina sailed into the Bay of All Saints at Salvador, Bahia, Brazil under the direction of a British prize crew. The appearance of this captured vessel with 517 Africans on board “set off alarms” all over the city. Many Bahians feared that disembarkation might cause the spread of disease and increase slave resistance in the city. As negotiations unfolded during the next 48 hours between Bahian authorities and British representatives, a group of 80 men attacked the Bella Miquelina in hopes of gaining control over the ship and taking the Africans. The British prize crew successfully held of this attack. In the midst of this turbulent milieu, a fugitive African slave named John Freeman rowed a small boat to the side of the Grecian and asked for assistance. Commander L.S. Tindal allowed Freeman to remain on board. Six weeks later, the Bella Miquelina returned to Sierra Leone and the Africans were freed by the British Vice-Admiralty Court at Freetown. One year later, Freeman returned to Sierra Leone on board H.M.S. Adventure as a free man. These events shed light on British strategies to suppress the slave trade to Brazil in 1848 as well as Brazilian and African responses. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In recent years, the EU and the U.S. have engaged in discussions to lower trade and investment barriers and strengthen transatlantic integration. For food and agricultural trade, non-tariff measures (NTMs) such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) stand out as significant barriers. This study combines sector-level econometric modeling with an agriculture-focused computable generable equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate various transatlantic liberalization scenarios on U.S.-EU agri-food trade. The simulations quantify the effect from tariff removal and addressing NTMs. The magnitude of the gains depend upon the level of tariff liberalization, the depth of integration, and possible consumer demand changes. © 2017},

abstract={This article analyzes the evolution of ethnographic texts written about Jê-speaking peoples of the interior of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from the 1760s through the 1830s. It interprets both the timing and content of these sources with reference to the emergence of Enlightenment thought, the development of a transatlantic community of letters, and the intervention of an idiosyncratic French military officer, Guido Marlière, who participated in Brazil's Botocudo War of 1808-31. Marlière's writing, informed by his long association with Jê peoples, mastery of their languages, and advocacy for more humane indigenous policy, was unprecedented in its cultural specificity. Marlière also contributed directly and indirectly to the production of canonical texts authored by European scientists. In this article, Bieber recovers Marlière's vivid, humanizing observations about Jê peoples and uses him as an example of how local actors contributed to the circulation of ideas and production of ethnographic knowledge. © 2017 by American Society for Ethnohistory.},

abstract={Can we talk about transatlantic democracy promotion? By addressing this issue from the perspective of transatlantic security communities, this article accepts that there are areas of convergence between the EU and the USA which might over time lead to a meaningful transatlantic partnership. But joint transatlantic democracy promotion is still only embryonic and only operates when both parties are faced with a crisis. Thus, while we can still speak of a transatlantic security community, a transatlantic democracy promotion community has yet to come into being and there is little indication that it will do so in the future. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={This article examines transnational kinship relations between Gambian parents in the UK and their children and carers in The Gambia, with a focus on the production, exchange and reception of photographs. Many Gambian migrant parents in the UK take their children to The Gambia to be cared for by extended family members. Mirroring the mobility of Gambian migrants and their children as they travel between the UK and The Gambia, photographs document changing family structures and relations. It is argued that domestic photography provides an insight into the representational politics, values and aesthetics of Gambian transatlantic kinship relations. Further, the concept of the moral economy supports a hermeneutics of Gambian family photographic practice and develops our understanding of the visual economy of transnational kinship relations in a number of ways: it draws attention to the way in which the value attributed to a photograph is rooted in shared moral and cultural codes of care within transnational relations of inequality and power; it helps us to interpret Gambians’ responses to and treatment of family photographs; and it highlights the importance attributed to portrait photography and the staging, setting and aesthetics of photographic content within a Gambian imaginary. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={This paper deals with task design in the context of a telecollaboration project which was carried out in a Business English course among students from Spain and the United States. The goal was to provide students with opportunities to develop linguistic, intercultural and digital competences by interacting and collaborating online with native speakers of the target language. A task-based approach was adopted and enriched by gamification, the different tasks being designed with a view towards engaging students intrinsically in the learning process. This was achieved by means of the adoption of gamification strategies and techniques such as the use of points, performance graphs, quests, avatars, a reward system, peer assessment and the use of social media. Via technological immersion, students from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were required to work together online to complete different tasks while exchanging peer feedback and assessment. The paper analyses and discusses participants’ views and perceptions about the gamified telecollaboration exchange. The quantitative and qualitative data were gathered by means of pre- and post-treatment questionnaires. Results indicate that students found this way of learning beneficial in terms of the development of different skills and competences (namely linguistic, digital and intercultural) and motivation. © 2017, AELFE.

abstract={We argue that NATO allies exhibiting more "Atlanticist" strategic cultures allocate a greater share of their defense resources to Alliance priorities than those exhibiting "Europeanist" strategic cultures. Our analysis builds on policy discussions regarding imbalances in burden-sharing in transatlantic security. Scholarship in the fields of international security and political economy offers plausible explanations for these imbalances, but does not address how allies allocate resources within defense budgets and does not statistically test effects of cultural variables on such decisions. Using evidence from 89 national security strategy documents of 24 NATO allies, we argue that the more states' strategic cultures tend toward Atlanticism, the more resources they allocated to military operations during a period in which such operations were the Alliance's top priority. During the height of NATO's "out of area" period from 2000 to 2012, there was a strong, positive correlation between, on the one hand, Atlanticist language in such documents and, on the other, allies' allocation of financial resources to military operations-as opposed to personnel, infrastructure, or equipment. © The Author (2017).

abstract={In the wake of the disclosures by Edward Snowden about NSA surveillance practices, a series of public hearings was held before the Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee of the European Parliament in 2013-2014. These hearings offer a wealth of information concerning the details of Snowden's claims, their implications for privacy rights, and the way in which the transatlantic political dialogue on these issues is unfolding. However, they have yet to receive academic attention. This article suggests that the LIBE Hearings were an important platform that rendered the contested Snowden files into public evidence of contemporary surveillance practices. Drawing on the concept of "material publics" proposed by Noortje Marres and others, we examine how the material setting of LIBE was crucial to the ways in which the Snowden files were made public in Europe. Valid evidence was produced, legal issues were identified, technological solutions were fostered, and responsibilities were enacted and denied.},

abstract={The Harmel review of 1966–7 is a story of how NATO collectively attempted to define a political role for itself; how France resisted; and how Germany was of two minds and hoped to resolve tensions by bridge-building. Much has changed since then—Britain is exiting the EU; Russia is an assertive but lesser power; the United States intends to pivot to Asia—but this underlying pattern remains. The cause hereof is a durable divide in French and German thinking on ‘political NATO’, meaning NATO as a framework for the coordination of key national security policies, as well as a framework that Europe's political organization cannot take place in opposition to. Political NATO was the foundation of the Harmel Report, and this certain idea of NATO continues to bedevil the Franco-German attempt to build Europe and refashion transatlantic relations. We should only take this effort seriously to the extent that the two countries have overcome their divide on political NATO. This article therefore explores the history and contemporary significance of French and German policy on political NATO and in particular three issues that dominated the Harmel Report: Europe's relationship with the wider Atlantic community, Russia's position in Europe's security order, and NATO's global engagement. While France and Germany have managed a certain rapprochement, the article concludes, their divide on political NATO continues to be of continental consequence. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

abstract={This book analyses the cooperation between the European Union and the United States on internal security and counter-terrorism since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In particular, four areas of cooperation are examined: customs and supply chain security; judicial cooperation (the mutual legal assistance and extradition agreements); law enforcement cooperation (the Europol-US agreements); and the EU-US agreements for the sharing of air passengers' data (PNR agreements). These cases are analysed through a conceptual framework based on the theories of international regimes, with the data being drawn from an extensive documentary analysis of media sources collected through the 'Nexis' database, official documents, and from 13 semi-structured elite interviews with US and EU officials. The book argues that the EU and the US have established a transatlantic internal security regime based on shared principles, norms, rules, and interests. While at the beginning of this process the EU had a more reactive and passive stance at the later stages both the EU and the US were active in shaping the transatlantic political agenda and negotiations. The book demonstrates how the EU has had a much more proactive role in its relations with the US than has often been assumed in the current literature. This book will be of much interest to students of EU policy, foreign policy, international security and IR in general. © 2017 Dimitrios Anagnostakis. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Afrocentric paradigm in social work is an important professional development towards rendering social work practice more culturally competent. Grounded in a critique of Eurocentric models of social science and social work practice, the paradigm draws heavily on the shared cultural values and practices of traditional Africa that have been articulated most poignantly in Cheikh Anta Diop’s two cradle theory. The Afrocentric paradigm also relies on the shared experiences African-Americans have had with Eurocentric domination since the initiation of the transatlantic slave trade and their efforts to contest the inimical effects of this form of oppression. This article provides a historical overview of the Afrocentric paradigm and examines its relationship to social work. It also offers some ideas about the future viability of the paradigm within the new era of oppression by incorporation. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This article traces the presence of Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío in Spanish literary criticism and film (1939-1944). The significance of his poetry, cosmopolitanism, nationality, race and modernist aesthetics pose a challenge to an early Francoist understanding of culture. Both literary criticism and propaganda film resorted to him as a way to legitimize and advance their respective aesthetic and political agendas. The struggle to rethink his position vis-à-vis Spanish culture reveals a series of factions and anxieties - aesthetic, historical, and political in nature - pertaining to the peninsular cultural field of the 1940s. Ultimately, these positionings highlight Darío's importance as a signifier of modernity in Transatlantic Hispanic culture.},

abstract={Social media have changed the way citizens, journalists, institutions, and activists communicate about social and political issues. However, questions remain about how information is diffused through these networks and the degree to which each of these actors is influential in communicating information. In this study, we introduce two novel social network measures of connection and information diffusion that help shed light on patterns of political communication online. The Audience Diversity Score assesses the diversity of a particular actor’s followers and identifies which actors reach different publics with their messages. The Communication Connector Bridging Score highlights the most influential actors in the network who are potentially able to connect different spheres of communication through their information diffusion. We apply and discuss these measures using Twitter data from the discussion regarding the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership in Europe. Our results provide unique insights into the role various actors play in diffusing political information in online social networks. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Major economies such as the United States, European Union, Japan, and even China have shifted trade negotiating emphasis toward ‘mega-regional’ agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This paper explores why countries have chosen to pursue mega-regionals, what is likely to be contained in the agreements, and some of their potential implications for the multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO). I call for revisiting the historical approach of introducing plurilateral and critical mass agreements – that would cover some of the mega-regionals’ new provisions – into the WTO so as to avoid a more substantial, long-run erosion of the relevance of the nondiscriminatory system. I also highlight potential reforms to the WTO's dispute settlement procedure that are required to strengthen its already prominent role. © 2017 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={The first installment of this two-part paper made a case for a conjunctural approach to urban studies, reserving a special place for the provisional formulation and ongoing revision of midlevel theories – from the entrepreneurial city to austerity urbanism and financialised urban governance – while positioning abstraction and contextualisation as simultaneous, dialogic practices. It follows that such arguments can be developed only so far in the absence of concrete cases, where conjunctural accounts actually gain traction, direction and purpose. Seeking to operationalise some of these methodological principles by way of a situated, single-city case study, this part of the paper returns to the financially challenged casino capital of Atlantic City, tracing its long (and notorious) history of entrepreneurial dealings, from Republican machine control to the ‘experiment’ with legalised gambling that was launched in the mid-1970s, and positioning the structural crisis that preceded the casino pact with the existential crisis that has been generated in the wake of the failure of this distinctive local growth machine. Atlantic City made a very large wager that did not pay off, the unravelling of its much-emulated model of entrepreneurial urbanism dramatising a distinctly ‘late-entrepreneurial’ moment of fiscally mandated governance and political crisis. © 2017, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2017.},

abstract={In August 1921 the Victorian maverick and “doyen of Anglo-American intellectuals” James Bryce visited the United States for a series of lectures on the subject of international relations. This was Bryce's final transatlantic venture, for the former ambassador to the United States died shortly afterwards. Flicking through the pages of Bryce's lectures, the reader is confronted with an array of themes driving the liberal thinking of the times: anxiety over the destabilizing effects of “propaganda” and the lure of communist and pan-nationalist agendas; defense of the moral kernel of state power; faith in the education of “public opinion” and the value of civic citizenship in bringing about positive patriotism in an era driven by nationalist antagonisms; uncertainty over the prospects of modern democracy and of imperial rule.

abstract={This essay recounts both the intertwined history of the hip-hop appropriation and the identification to the figure of Michael Jackson in Gabon, from the 1980s to nowadays. It questions how transatlantic musical dialogues have provided the African youth with a way of representing a black subject freed from (post)colonial complexes. Drawing on historical and ethnographic data, this paper focuses on several imitators of Michael Jackson, and mainly on the case of Michael Anicet, a dancer who built his career and his fame on the imitation of Michael Jackson choreographies. It describes his pathway, his performances and how he transformed Michael Jackson’s dances in order to ‘gabonize’ it, focusing mainly on his reception and appropriation of the song and choreography of the track ‘They don’t care about us’. This essay finally proves how the identification to global black icons has constituted the lever for an identity construction which combines nationalist claims and connections with a transnational blackness. © 2017 Journal of African Cultural Studies},

In Britain, this term is sometimes used; however, ‘subeditor’ appears more frequently when referring to recirculating texts; http://mappingtexts.org/quality/index.html, Digital searching is improving as a research tool but its quality is uneven across search platforms. Where some texts can be located, others remain hidden in the digital archive. The online platform ‘Mapping Texts’, provides an interactive tool for assessing digitization quality in newspapers. Users can select different newspapers to see the division between ‘good words’ (words that are recognized by optical character recognition searches) versus the total words in a given publication; The 19th Century UK Periodicals database returned 3766 hits with the word ‘mother’ in Ladies’ Treasury.

abstract={This paper analyses Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations in order to assess how the move towards tighter economic integration within the EU‒US strategic partnership impacts on legislative‒executive relations in EU trade policy. The analysis examines the institutional, substantive and party political dimensions of national parliaments’ scrutiny of the Common Commercial Policy. Based on insights into both domestic and EU channels of parliamentary monitoring of TTIP negotiations, the paper argues that, although the government remains the central object of democratic control, the involvement of national parliaments in transatlantic trade extends to encompass the EU’s own transatlantic and trade policies. This is rooted in the legislatures’ legal capacity to constrain the executive in the negotiation, conclusion and, where applicable, ratification phases of EU trade agreements. It is argued that national parliamentary influence takes the shape of politicisation of the legitimacy of the expected policy outcomes of these agreements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The Deal Versus the People was a theatrical response created by people in Bradford (UK) to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). A controversial trade deal between the European Union and United States being negotiated at the time of the production, TTIP threatened to deepen trade liberalisation, with potentially negative impacts for communities on both sides of the Atlantic. In this article, I examine the ways The Deal Versus the People critically engaged with TTIP, and the neoliberal economic paradigm that it is an expression of, by mobilising a ‘commons’ across the theatrical and social landscapes of its production. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article takes a new approach to the question of postwar American welfare state ‘exceptionalism’ by arguing that scholars should look at ideas and discourses of American welfare exceptionalism in historical context as a social construct and a political project. By focusing on the National Association of Real Estate Boards’ lobbying campaign against US public housing legislation in the late 1940s, I show that US business interests often used the example of Western European welfare state initiatives in order to not only decisively shaped specific pieces of social legislation, but to contest the very meaning of the postwar New Deal state. © 2017 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This article challenges the conventional wisdom that the cohesion and institutional health of NATO was seriously threatened by the policies pursued by the George W. Bush administration in the US during its first term. On the basis of case studies of decisions made in 2001-2003 regarding the Balkans, the response to 9/ 11, and defending Turkish airspace in the build-up to the war with Iraq, it argues that NATO’s status as a robust and mature international institution helped it to effectively channel and blunt potentially serious challenges to its cohesion and effectiveness; both from the Bush administration and from European governments sceptical about aspects of Bush’s approach. Consequently, NATO was not seriously or lastingly damaged by the disputes that did arise during this period. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={Since the year 2000 Russia has taken increasing interest in Latin America with commerce being paramount. Moreover, in 2015 Russian-Cuban relations are at their most robust politically since 1991, but they differ from Moscow’s relationship with the rest of the region as Russian-Cuban trade remains extremely low. This article will posit that the forms of economic dependence that existed in Soviet-Cuban relations in the period from 1959 to 1991 are key. As a result, Russian-Cuban trade since 1991 displays similarities to the decolonisation process that took place in the second half of the twentieth century with this explaining the current low level of bilateral trade. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={This article uses a transatlantic lens to reassess interracial relationships in 1950s Britain. Although mixed-race couples in this country suffered serious discrimination, Britain appeared relatively progressive to African Americans on the other side of the Atlantic engaged in a struggle for recognition of their constitutional rights. In contrast to the United States, there were no laws in Britain that prohibited interracial marriage. The British also appeared more open to public discussion of relationships that crossed the colour line including the production of several films that focused attention on this controversial subject. This apparently more inclusive attitude towards gender and race relations provided an inspirational model to African Americans in their fight for equality. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

This article considers the desert romance in light of nomadic theory as a response to the First World War that engages with the glorification of the Middle East campaigns and manipulates the figure of the nomad, popularized by T. E. Lawrence’s part in the Arab revolt, to articulate women’s heightened sense of estrangement from the nation and their hopes to become active agents in rebuilding British national identity in the post-war era. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Deploying the call-and-response mode as the artistic premise of her fiction, foremost African-American author, Toni Morrison, has persistently called in her criticism for a participatory, intellectual and political, engagement with her position on and concerns around blackness. Morrison’s ideas are being critiqued and expanded to reflect contemporary ‘African’ attitudes and perspectives within the contemporary Afrodiasporic writing of critically acclaimed emergent author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. In particular, Adichie has, in conversation and in her most recent fiction, suggested that Africans (in the diaspora) articulate themselves differently from African-Americans. Problematized and politicized thus as contested, rather than universally accepted, subjective terrain, blackness more significantly points to the diversity and dynamism of black culture and testifies, in the current socio-political/-historical moment, to recognition of the enduring complexity of black subjectivity. In a close, comparative reading of Morrison’s celebrated novel, Song of Solomon (1977), and Adichie’s popular text, Americanah (2013)–both recipients of the National Book Critics Circle award, this essay offers a fresh, specifically transatlantic and transnational, analysis of Morrison’s African-American views on blackness through the contemporary, Afrodiasporic lens of Adichie. Guided by the dialogic call-and-response mode, and underpinned by cultural, race and diaspora theory, the essay suggests and explores the ways in which Americanah speaks (back) to Morrison’s Song of Solomon, interrogating ontologies of race, particularly blackness, through an ‘Africanness’ that takes cognizance of culturally specific and context-responsive, globalized configurations of female subjectivity in particular. In this way, this essay seeks to expand understandings of, and discussions around, black issues and black life in order not just to resituate the relevance of black cultural ontologies but, through comparative engagement with the ‘politics’ of blackness, to revive in the political consciousness and imagination their crucial significance. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Using an analytical framework based on the concept of historical distance, this article explores how Dutch history teachers and educators navigate between the past and the present when making curriculum decisions on the sensitive topic of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Slavery. Four history teachers and 2 museum educators were selected on the criteria of ethnicity, professional context, and student audience. They were interviewed twice, using open questions and a task-based design directed at 14–15-year-old students of various cultural backgrounds. Two conclusions are drawn: (1) the curriculum decisions of the selected participants can be interpreted as configurations of historical distance, which are the result of interactions between various types of knowledge, values, and beliefs. Some participants make a distinction between their own personal distancing and the curriculum decisions they take, while others do not or are unsure about deciding, and (2) curriculum decisions are difficult to predict. Some teachers and educators have a preference for certain distancing approaches but do not always follow it, depending on the historical sources they are dealing with. The conclusion discusses how research on history teaching can be facilitated by a deeper comprehension of the decisions teachers and educators make as navigators of historical distance. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to analyse the foreign policy activism of former Democratic US Congressman Frank McCloskey during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. From 1992 until the end of his term in 1994, McCloskey played a key part in keeping the issue of Bosnia alive on Capitol Hill. An early and a consistent advocate of the ‘lift and strike’ policy, McCloskey pioneered use of the term genocide to describe atrocities being perpetrated in Bosnia. Along with other Bosnia hawks, McCloskey succeeding in passing landmark June 1994 amendment to lift the UN-imposed arms embargo on Bosnia, which paved the way for the adoption by both chambers of Congress of legislation to lift the embargo in the summer of 1995. This congressional pressure on the Administration contributed to the US diplomatic effort that culminated in the Dayton Peace Accords. Though McCloskey’s congressional career ended in late 1994, his impact over the preceding two years firmly placed him among the most articulate American voices on the issue of Bosnia. His 1992-1994 congressional mandate now stands as his lasting foreign policy legacy. © 2016 Board of Transatlantic Studies.},

abstract={There is a great deal of uncertainty in the realm of international intellectual property law, with the EU and the US negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a trade agreement that aims to remove trade barriers across different economic sectors to increase trade between the EU and the US while embedding investor to state dispute settlement mechanisms into the agreement.1 The TTIP will have spill over effects on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Australia, the Asian sub-continent and the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) which will be the main focus of this article. The impact of the TTIP on the GCC will require a fresh analysis of their intellectual property laws and international trade agreements (Pratap, J. 2013. Proposed US-EU trade deal may impact business in GCC: report. Accessed 21 June 2016. http://www.bilaterals.org/?proposed-us-eu-trade-deal-may#sthash.aXZVR17g.dpuf). As the US and EU finalise the TTIP, there is also the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that could impact third party countries. The article will analyse both the TTIP and TTP in regard to the potential ramifications of the agreements on developing Islamic states like the GCC states in respect of intellectual property protection, with particular emphasis on investor to state dispute settlements. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This essay examines Roberto Arlt’s journalistic account of visits to peripheral Spanish geographies on the Atlantic, Morocco and Galicia, by focusing not only on travel’s engagement with mobility and storytelling, but also with the cultural capital the traveler hopes to gain at home, and on the national stage. By referencing both the Atlantic and also Arlt’s North African travels along the Mediterranean, the essay aims at opening up lines of interconnectivity, interdependency, and inter-relational flows to and from the Atlantic on a more global scale. It contributes to the repositioning of Atlantic discourses (and their respective geopolitics) and in doing so examines the role of the uneven modernity that informed Arlt’s travel gaze. Coining the term “travel as technique” as a critical notion, it refers to the praxis of writing travel alongside history, a praxis through which Arlt documented Spanish political turbulence and the rivalry between global colonial powers in 1935. Departing from a critical cosmopolitanism stance (Homi Bhabha, Pheng Cheah, et al.), it follows the “Hispanic relocation” (Joseba Gabilondo) and “engages the Atlantic” (Benita Sampedro Vizcaya), from a global perspective that, in various formulations of Arlt’s cosmopolitan critique, includes class-consciousness and its connectivity with the Mediterranean and African geopolitical flows. The critical examination of the elite cosmopolitan “genteel tradition” (David Viñas) in Arlt’s Galician travelogue draws on the attention the Argentine author paid to relations of social class and power in the realm of Atlantic politics, but also in the realm of cultural production and consumption on both sides of the ocean. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The article investigates the various formulas and constructions expressing and contributing to the evolution of ‘Transatlantic community’ as regional transcontinental set of relationships; political and discursive construction of shared principles, values, and strategies; and social/sociological reality. The suggested analysis provides a critical reappraisal of some of its fundamental elements of definition, ideology, political structure and social-historical complexity, while attempting to contrast between the systemic and intrasystemic views of community. The interpretation reveals the necessity to ask ourselves whether there exist something like a ‘Transatlantic community’ that can be defined in sociological sense, and, secondly, to question the uses and limits of a sociology of international relations as sociology of transatlantic community. The article concludes on some mutations at the level of sociological epistemology, that would ultimately reposition a legitimate focus on Transatlantic community, beyond its critical histories, suprapolitical reality, restrictive policies, and Manichaean ideology. © 2017, Babes-Bolyai University.

abstract={Policy debate on the implications of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) for Turkey has focused almost exclusively on "how" Turkey can/will take part in a forthcoming transatlantic deal. Turkey's association with a TTIP has largely been conceived as an inevitable and beneficial policy choice to re-engage Ankara with the Atlantic alliance and emerging transatlantic trade framework. The arguments for extending TTIP to Turkey have mostly been built upon a conventional understanding of preferential trade agreements. The debate has not provided a comprehensive assessment of costs and benefits for Turkey's exclusion from or joining TTIP as it dismissed multiple dimensions of the "deep integration" agenda which underpined the transatlantic talks. This paper intends to contribute to the "why" debate with a thorough analysis of critical issues on the transatlantic agenda by evaluating economic and policy implications of TTIP both for exclusion and association scenarios together with associated compliance and adjustment costs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The paper exploits a newly created dataset offering several detailed bibliometric data and indicators on 251 subject categories for a large sample of universities in Europe, North America and Asia. In particular, it addresses the controversial issue of the distance between Europe and USA in research excellence (so called “transatlantic gap”). By building up indicators of objective excellence (top 10% worldwide in publications and citations) and subjective excellence (top 10% in the distribution of share of top journals out of total production at university level), it is shown that European universities fail to achieve objective measures of global excellence, while being competitive only in few fields. The policy implications of this state of affairs are discussed. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={This article deals with the negotiations between the United States of America (USA) and the European Union (EU) on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, with a specific focus on agriculture and food. Drawing on the negotiations strategy/ politics of international trade negotiations approach, it conceptualises the setting in terms of preferences, institutions and geopolitics, also paying particular attention to the EU's complex role as an actor. It argues that the EU and the USA, both being used to asymmetrical power politics in the past, took advantage of institutional constraints (EU) and geopolitics (USA) to strengthen their bargaining positions. However, since they faced equally powerful players the power game led to suboptimal outcomes in terms of narrowing the opportunity for an agreement.},

abstract={The article deals with the institutional aspects of the EU-US negotiation process on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The starting hypothesis infers that the long-term duration of the negotiations as well as their non-transparency to the general public can be explained by the contents of the agenda or by single countries' positions, but also by the inconsistency of supranational EU institutions' actions. The authors cast light upon the inter-ministerial competition and rivalry, which tends to be an internal problem of many national economic diplomacy systems. This problem becomes acute in the process of decision taking and concluding complex trade policy deals to a larger extent than in the routine work of the structures involved. Currently this phenomenon may be witnessed not only on the national but also on the supranational level, especially because of some imperfect coordination of actions between the European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) on TTIP issues. Having been a key point of the transatlantic dialogue since 2013, TTIP has a large prehistory. The authors analyze the main stages of the latter - the Transatlantic Declaration (1990), the New Transatlantic Agenda (1995), the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (1998) and the Transatlantic Economic Council (2007) focusing on the institutional framework of European and American authorities' interaction as defined by the above agreements. Further, the article examines the ongoing TTIP negotiations with regard to 'post-Lisbon' Europe with enhanced authority of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the EEAS established in 2010. Despite the fact that the work of these institutes was aimed at consolidating the EU economic diplomacy system, in the area in question there tend to be two practically non-interacting channels of communication with US counterparts. Moreover, the level European diplomats' involvement can be considered a rather low one. According to the authors, such situation creates additional obstacles to achieving consensus on the TTIP.},

abstract={The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations have become the centre of debate in EU trade policy, where the European Commission and civil society organizations are key actors. This article argues that a key reason why TTIP has become so controversial has to do with the nature of the arguments used by each side. The main arguments in favour of TTIP emphasize the economic and geostrategic benefits. The main criticisms of TTIP focus on its alleged negative impact on product safety and public policies. Identifying the foundational assumption(s) behind these arguments, we show that this debate is special because opponents and supporters’ premises emerge from assumptions based on different perspectives: while opponents assume that the EU will succumb to neoliberal American preferences, supporters focus on the US-EU combined market power vis-à-vis third countries. Since these assumptions do not necessarily contradict each other, the debate is less whether benefits outweigh costs and more whether such costs are probable, leaving the supporters with a defensive position. This is an important distinction in explaining why opponents dominate the public debate. Our findings also indicate, however, that opponents’ thesis has been successful because the US is the partner; such public mobilization is less probable on other trade agreements. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.},

abstract={Based on an ethnographic fieldwork, the text considers the passionate adult settings resulting from the encounter of European tourists and Brazilian women in the seaside neighbourhood of Ponta Negra (Natal-RN, north-eastern Brazil). The analysis focuses on the female expectations, strategies and practices present in these transatlantic relations, assuming the impossibility of establishing a rigid demarcation between money and love, between programas and other forms of intimacy. Most women manage their relationships through a similar set of purposes, although considered and weighted variably. Material interests tend to assume great importance and transversality. However, they are interwoven with many other significant desires and projects in the domains of gender, conjugality, family and migrations. In pursuing these purposes, women demonstrate ingenious micropolitical procedures of intimacy, trying to compensate the adverse social position vis-à-vis the European tourists, structurally privileged by the intersections of nationality, class, "race" and gender.},

abstract={Economics was central to Europe’s problems in the early 1980s and its successes after 1985. But to view the European Community solely in this manner disregards the enduring importance of the quest for European peace. European leaders used the integration process as a mechanism to influence East–West relations and the Middle East. Peace rhetoric and symbolism sustained the core Franco-German partnership. European integration was crucial to the continent’s ability to peacefully absorb a huge shock in the form of German unification. And the Community’s role in exporting democracy, first to southern Europe, then to Eastern Europe, confirmed that integration was about more than just the Single Market. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Another delay of the signature of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) after fifteen rounds of talks, and protectionist rhetoric of the newly-elected US President Donald Trump give a good reason to think about the future of the agreement between the EU and the USA. The author takes into account the interest of the negotiators in strengthening their joint position in the world and mutual liberalization. However, the author points to a fundamental difference in the logic and practice of trade regulation and competition on both sides of the Atlantic. In particular, the author notes individual features that cannot be included in the common model such as the EU precautionary principle and the European system of protection of geographical indications. The article also highlights the difference between the EU and the US in their goals of standardization and conformity assessment procedures. Their positions differ significantly on the issue of the protection of competition. Finally, the EU has a negative view towards the US non-interference in the activities of the largest monopolies and the market of state orders. These differences limit the subject of discussion and impede the creation of a common economic model. The EU and the United States tend to preserve their identity in the areas of consumer and environment protection, standardization, competition. The negotiations become a means of competitive positioning of their models. At the same time it is an example of tolerant interaction of competing poles. The estimate also allows to rethink the outcome of the EU-Russia dialog and to stress its useful results. The author believes that Russia adopted many elements of the institutional model of the European Union. These elements are embedded in the practice of the Eurasian economic Union (EAEU). So, there is a chance to use them as a basis for a potential dialogue between EU and EAEU.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP). The EU and the USA are negotiating the TTIP, a trade agreement that aims to remove trade barriers across different economic sectors to increase trade between the EU and the USA. The TTIP will have spill over effects on the MENA region, the GCC, Australia and the Asian sub-continent, as it raises key questions for intellectual property and international trade agreements. For instance, will the USA and EU be on an equal footing or will one triumph over the other, will third party countries like the GCC states be expected to adopt new standards. Design/methodology/approach: The research design is a paper and online data collection method to find literature to date on intellectual property law development in the GCC states in relation to the three research objectives as set out above. The literature is the population, and this could prove problematic. Different databases have been used to cover all sources where data can be found. Findings: As the EU-USA TTIP is aiming to conclude by the end of 2015, the GCC has an opportunity to reassess its relationship with both the EU and GCC. Up until now, the GCC was able to enter into negotiations with the EU and USA relatively independently. However, where the EU and USA can agree, there will be a harmonisation of regulations. This therefore has repercussions for the GCC. The TTIP has three main aims: to increase trade and investment through market access, increase employment and competitiveness and create a harmonised approach to global trade. To harmonise global trade, the EU and USA aim to harmonise their intellectual property rights through an intellectual property rights chapter that deals specifically with enhancing protection and recognition for geographical indications, build on TRIPS and patentability. Research limitations/implications: This study is non-empirical. Originality/value: The TTIP will have spill over effects for the GCC, as it has yet to finalise the EU-GCC free trade agreement and USA-GCC framework agreement. The power dynamics between the USA and EU will be a deciding factor on the intellectual property chapter in the TTIP in terms of what the provisions for intellectual property will look like and what powers will be available to investors to bring investor-state-dispute settlement claims against foreign countries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The European Commission hopes that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) will result in increasing wealth, more competitiveness and hundreds of thousands of new jobs. There are also plans to harmonize standards and to introduce or monitor new regulations and norms - beside and above national legislation - that go beyond the existing member state legal framework and are to be safeguarded by means of regulatory collaboration and legal supervision. To the extent observable after the 15th round of negotiations between the European Commission and the US administration, the debate on the TTIP has not yet reached planning law, construction law or procurement law in practice. However, the chapter on "investment" of the TTIP-draft is of paramount importance for the land policies in the member states. Land as immovable properties is mentioned explicitly as an investment asset covered by TTIP. Land policy is the "blind spot" in investment protection agreements. This paper analyses the undergoing dynamics for the comprehensive land policy structure in Germany and its capital Berlin. Berlin plays a leading role in the current discourse of the realignment of land policy and the renaissance of public affordable housing policies. The purpose test of TTIP - according to the hierarchy of norms from the constitutional and national sphere down to the municipal level - will comprise of the criteria fairness, legitimacy, the balancing of investors' expectations (and potentially their claims), and states' regulatory measures. My paper explains why the standards and provisions of TTIP potentially conflict with the constitutionally guaranteed locally self-government in land policy as community institution(s) and the efficiency of urban planning. The democratic legitimacy of TTIP remains to be verified since the controversial relation and distinction between lawful regulation, the fair and equitable treatment standard, and indirect expropriation under the "TTIP-regime" lack substantial empirical evidence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the centre of war in the Middle East. Three events, the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the UN resolution of 1947, and the beginning of the occupation after the so-called Six Day War mark significant defeats in the Palestinian conflict and, moreover, are key events of the Jewish-Arab confrontation. Paech draws attention to some elements of this history which are responsible for the permanent terror in this conflict and have prevented a peaceful solution. Historically and at present, they include a militant form of Zionism and the interests of European colonialism that have expanded into transatlantic imperialism. However, crucial is also a weakness on the Arab side which led to a lack of sufficient support to the Palestinian resistance against an internationally supported military in Israel. The tragedy of the resistance manifests itself in the separation of Fatah and Hamas, which was deliberately fostered by Israel and the US. Furthermore, there is the demographic factor that plays an important role in the proclaimed two-state solution, which Isreali governments have successfully undermined with their settlement policy. Neither does an alternative war∗ (Moshe Zuckermann) for a two state solution, nor does Apartheid within one state promise peace.},

abstract={This article applies recent scholarship concerned with transatlantic mobility and print cultures to a comparative study of images of transpacific travel for women during the interwar period. During the 1920s and 1930s female travelers splashed spectacularly across the pages of mainstream, popular magazines produced in America, Britain, and the wider Anglophone world. Focusing on two magazines that launched in this era, Th e Australian Woman's Mirror (1924- 1961) and Chatelaine (1928-), this article explores Australian and Canadian fictional portrayals of the traveling woman of the interwar years to examine the ways in which the mobility of the modern girl became a screen for anxieties and fantasies of these two national print imaginaries. By paying attention to the different portrayals of female mobility through the Pacific from both sides of the ocean, this article also considers the intersection between actual travel, ideas about travel, and notions of gendered social mobility. © Transfers.},

abstract={Do voters' assessments of the government's foreign policy performance influence their vote intentions? Does the 'clarity of responsibility' in government moderate this relationship? Existing research on the United States demonstrates that the electorate's foreign policy evaluations influence voting behaviour. Whether a similar relationship exists across the advanced democracies in Europe remains understudied, as does the role of domestic political institutions that might generate responsibility diffusion and dampen the effect of foreign policy evaluations on vote choice. Using the attitudinal measures of performance from the 2011 Transatlantic Trends survey collected across 13 European countries, these questions are answered in this study through testing on incumbent vote the diffusion-inducing effects of five key domestic factors frequently used in the foreign policy analysis literature. Multilevel regression analyses conclude that the electorate's ability to assign punishment decreases at higher levels of responsibility diffusion, allowing policy makers to circumvent the electoral costs of unpopular foreign policy. Specifically, coalition governments, semi-presidential systems, ideological dispersion among the governing parties and the diverse allocation of the prime ministerial and foreign policy portfolios generate diffusion, dampening the negative effects of foreign policy disapproval on vote choice. This article contributes not only to the debate on the role of foreign policy in electoral politics, but also illustrates the consequential effects of domestic institutions on this relationship. © 2017 European Consortium for Political Research.},

abstract={Trade and Investment Agreements (TIAs) have been widely criticized for their potentially negative effects on health. Many governments, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, have voiced concerns that mega-regional agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, will erode governments’ scope for health protection, weakening for instance those options that remain permissible under World Trade Organization rules. Further, these mega-regional agreements will set default standards and rules of the game that even non-signatories will need to emulate in order to be competitive in the global market. This article begins by reviewing the changing structure of trade and investment policy, global production, and the relation between the two. The effects of TIAs on health are then analysed, based on some of the most relevant evidence. Key power asymmetries within the global trade and investment architecture are described, and the way they influence how trade rules are made, implemented and adjudicated. Section 5 examines a particularly striking and topical instance of such power asymmetries, investor-state dispute settlement provisions in TIAs, and their relevance to health. The article concludes with recommendations to mitigate the potential negative health externalities of TIAs. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.},

abstract={Based on the unparalleled number of recent data protection reforms triggered by Snowden's revelations on both sides of the Atlantic, this article aims to examine the interplay between the two main transatlantic actors striking the balance between national security and privacy, namely EU and US policy-makers and courts. We argue, on the one hand, that the NSA affair has opened a window to policy-makers to pursue reforms in order to attain a level of adequacy of their respective data protection legal regimes. On the other hand, although some data protection reforms have been adopted by legislators in response to courts acting as reformers in the post-Snowden context, the EU and US courts' approaches to balancing national security and data protection remain diametrically opposite. Drawing upon recent case law, we demonstrate that US courts continue to tilt the balance in favour of national security while EU courts retain their pro-privacy stance. © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={How did the character John Bull come to be so widely recognized as a stand-in for the British government or people? John Arbuthnot created the character in 1712 in a series of five pamphlets criticizing the British role in the War of the Spanish Succession, and for fifty years the character was mentioned only in references to Arbuthnot. In the late eighteenth century, John Bull began to appear in newspaper articles relating to other political contexts, eventually appearing in satires on all manner of British policies and characteristics, from taxes and the economy to xenophobia and imperialism. This essay argues that the American colonists adapted the character to their own purposes. This analysis contributes to the understanding of the content, political engagement, and spread of the press in eighteenth-century Britain and America. It also reveals one way that writers about British national identity and its symbolism accounted for an increasingly diverse global empire that could not be represented adequately by a single figurehead. © Copyright 2017 The North American Conference on British Studies.},

abstract={On the 23rd of June 2016, the Brexit caused a shock in Europe. According to some analyses, the departure of the United Kingdom would open up the possibility of a new step for the European Union Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). Paris and Berlin could form a core group and shape a political and military Europe. This theory should be questioned. The longstanding opposition of the United Kingdom to a European Defense that might challenge NATO must not hide contradictions and conflicts among the other EU member states. In many ways, Atlanticism still constitutes the essential reference point. Surely, the uncertainties linked to the election of Donald Trump (an «American Brexit»?) incite to a bigger joint military effort but the project for European defense is undermined by what the theory of public goods puts into evidence: without a hegemonic actor, a collective purpose does not always means a collective action. In short term, the goal is to develop a Europe with military capabilities rather than a European defense. This would also strengthen the negotiating power of the European allies in the transatlantic relationship.},

abstract={There has been much debate in recent times between the Anglo-American tradition of curriculum studies and the Continental and North European tradition of didactics (Didaktik). As important as such debate has been, this book seeks to add new voices to the debate representing ideas and traditions from a different part of the world. The focus is on Chinese curriculum thinking that has passed through a number of stages and currently represents a blend of some aspects of the American tradition and Chinese cultural traditions. How does Chinese thinking about curriculum, teaching and learning resonate with European didactic traditions and what are the implications for theorizing an expanded field of curriculum studies? This book deliberately transcends borders and cultures to explore new territory, to provide a platform for open dialogue and to open up new areas of investigation. Chapters include • Curriculum Reform and Research in China: A Social-Historical Perspective • What Mathematics Did Teachers Learn? Comparison of the School and the Pre-Service Teacher Mathematics Curricula in Germany and Taiwan • Living in Parallel Worlds: A Transatlantic Dialogue between General Didactics and Instructional Design. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, John Chi-Kin Lee and Kerry J.

abstract={This article examines the history and recent pro-immigrant installations of the postcolonial Museum of the Americas in Madrid. It critically relates the Hispanist “White Legend” regarding the benevolence of Spanish colonialism to both the “pact of silence” following Spain’s Civil War and the current Spanish orientation towards immigrants from Latin America. Despite significant recent reconceptualization, the museum continues to put forward a narrative in which Spain is represented as a benevolent and civilizing contributor to Latin America. The museum’s more recent inclusionist turn to welcoming and serving Latin American immigrant communities in Spain does not complicate the pro-colonialism stance but rather, through a strategically neutral curatorial style, further serves to insist on a positive framing of the past. The exhibit analysed in this article highlights the innocence of Latin American children in order to frame immigration as positive while simultaneously supporting the “White Legend”. Contemporary Spanish tendencies towards forgetting or silencing the past have a deeper history than is usually recognized, and in this case study, these tendencies work to occlude not just the violence of the colonial period but also the inequities of today’s immigration. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Scholarly work on the transatlantic slave trade has tended to focus on the volume, conditions and the profits of this hideous commerce and its demographic, economic and social impact on the coastal areas of Atlantic Africa. Much has therefore been published about the history of specific ports and coastal regions, but still little is known about the contribution of the slave trade to the overall formation and shaping of the Atlantic Africa port system and its regional port sub-systems, the links between various ports, their commercial struggles, and the variable factors that conditioned changes in their role within the system. This study will partly address these issues by examining how the slave trade, in conjunction with other local, regional and international economic and political dynamics, contributed to the rise and fall of ports in Atlantic Africa and helped shape its port system. In doing so, the analysis is based on shipping information gathered from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, and on the specific literature on various slave ports in Atlantic Africa. © 2017 International Maritime Economic History Association.},

abstract={With rapid scientific and technological advances, a new genetic era is emerging. However, these advances raise ethical and legal issues, particularly genetic discrimination, that may threaten advancing science in the absence of appropriate regulation. There is currently no concrete legislative position in this area at EU level, but rather a patchwork of diverging legislative approaches amongst Member States. Genetic discrimination has been singled out as an area of reform in Europe as evidenced, for example in EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 21.1 prohibiting discrimination based on 'genetic features.' The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also informs this debate and may spur legislative action. From a transatlantic perspective, the United States' federal legislation (Genetic Information Non Discrimination Act) is noteworthy. Considering scientific and technological developments, the rights at stake and the various regulatory benchmarks, this paper explores the regulation of genetic information in the EU. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

abstract={As the first installment of a two-part article exploring contemporary transformations in metropolitan governance in the wake of the entrepreneurial turns of the 1980s and subsequent waves of neoliberalisation and financialisation, a case is outlined here for a ‘conjunctural’ approach to urban analysis. This can be considered to be complementary to, but at the same time distinct from, some of the concurrent approaches to comparative urbanism, in that it explicitly problematises the relative positioning of cities in the context of uneven development and multiscalar relations, as well as the dialogic connections between case studies, midlevel concepts and revisable theory claims. Taking as its point of departure the current financial and political crisis in Atlantic City, the New Jersey casino capital, the article historicises the concept of the entrepreneurial city, placing this in the context, successively, of the evolving ‘commonsense’ of neoliberal governance, the emergence of austerity urbanism and the intensification of financialised restructuring. In tracing an arc from more abstract theory claims through to the specific circumstances of contemporary urban restructuring in the United States, the article sets the stage for the more granular and concrete analysis of ‘late-entrepreneurial’ Atlantic City to follow in Part 2. To the extent that it is necessary to construct some of this staging, this first part of the article reflects on some of the methodological implications of a conjunctural approach to urban studies. © 2016, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.},

abstract={Article 14.13 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement - the data localization (DL) clause - represents the first time that a far-reaching preferential trade agreement (PTA) seeks to reduce protectionism arising from data residency (DR) requirements. The DL clause, however, is linked to a loose GATT Article XX-like exception: Article 14.13(3)(b), which allows the parties to maintain DR measures to achieve a legitimate public policy objective as long as the measure in question can satisfy the ‘necessity test’. The ambiguity of the DL exception will be clarified by TPP tribunals when a real dispute occurs. After examining the rationales of the DR measures in the context of the necessity test, we find that the responding party invoking a DL exception will have strong arguments, especially when defending Types II and III of the DR measures. Arguments could be made that there is a genuine relationship between the ends, i.e. privacy protection, and the means, i.e. the DR measures. In addition, the responding party invoking a DL exception in a potential dispute would undoubtedly argue that the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) cannot qualify as a ‘genuine alternative’, because the proposed measure must not only be ‘less trade restrictive’ than the DR measures, but should also ‘preserve for (the responding party’s) right to achieve its desired level of protection’ with respect to law enforcement or a criminal investigation. Based upon our findings, we argue that with regard to Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations on e-commerce, the major challenge of trade negotiators is the disciplinary fragmentation of global economic regulation. The DR issues in question confirm that international economic law (IEL) correlates to other areas of law. Future negotiations require more collaborative and interdisciplinary solutions through productive dialogue with experts in private international law and criminal procedure law. True and substantial changes in the theories and practices of Internet jurisdiction would allow us to argue for a more narrow interpretation of the DL exception - rendering it more difficult to satisfy the necessity test. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.},

Conceptually, DR requirements can be seen as a sub-set of the so-called forced localization measures (FLMs). For the present purpose, we focus on DR, while acknowledging the growing concerns about other FLMs. For discussions of other FLMs in the TPP; Liu, H.-W., The Political Economy Behind the Encryption Clauses in the TPP Agreement (2017) J.

Initiative, International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) and World Economic Forum; The DR requirements affecting services delivered electronically could come under the ambit of Ch. 10. Thus, while this limited space bars us from undertaking a detailed examination of all possible provisions applicable to DR, it would be remiss not to consider certain disciplines in Ch. 10 to the extent that they are relevant to the above-mentioned anti-protectionism instruments; Concerns over this carve-out has led to some proposals from the US to add new clauses in the TPP to prohibit regulators from imposing DR requirements on financial service companies. However, as Deputy U.S Trade Representative Robert Holleyman suggests, it is problematic to ‘take bits and pieces of TPP and reopen it for negotiation’, these concerns are most likely to be addressed in future trade negotiations.

It is reported that this initiative has been concretized as part of the consolidated plan to build up Germany’s new IT infrastructure by 2022; this plan has raised concerns about the possible introduction of DR requirements that would undermine e-commerce.

(29. Oct. 2015); It should be noted that however the Schengen routing regime or Germany’s Bundesloud, if effective, may arguably move the EU towards the Type I or Type II DR; http://www.globalequityequation.com, Some refer to measures that require firms to keep data for a particular minimum period of time as ‘data retention’ requirements and those with local storage mandates as ‘data residency’. See e.g. Lothar Determann et al., Residency Requirements for Data in Clouds – What Now?, Privacy and Security Law Report; TPP Agreement, supra n. 1, Art. 14.3; In the same vein, measures that introduce the public cloud (e.g. Germany’s proposed Bundescloud) would not be caught by the TPP’s DL clause so long as they satisfy Art. 14.2; Cross-border financial data transfer is subject to, among other provision, Art. 11.6 and terms and conditions as laid down in each TPP member’s commitment. Certain TPP members, including Canada, Chile, Peru, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, and Vietnam, has imposed additional restrictions on transfer and processing of financial data. Canada, for instance, adopts a sort of Type I DR by requiring that ‘cross-border financial services supplier maintain a local agent and records in Canada’ (emphasis added). See TPP Agreement, Annex 11-A: Canada; http://kelly.house.gov/, Unlike Ch. 14, Ch. 11 does not have the DL clause. This carve-out has raised concerns about potential trade barriers. In Jan. 2016, a group of Congressmen from the US thus urged the Obama Administration to remove the exemption.

abstract={Right from the first very chapters of the European construction under the Treaty of Rome (1957), which turns 60 this year 2017, the jurisprudence by the Court of Justice has truly been decisive to shape the constitutional dimension of the European Community legal order. In a series of historical decisions, the CJEU has affirmed its primacy, its binding efficacy and unity, while guaranteeing its uniform interpretation and implementation. But it has also, above all, enshrined the fundamental rights resulting from the common constitutional traditions as a source of European Law (i.e general principles). This legal doctrine has been ultimately consolidated in positive Law, finally, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (TL) in 2009, incorporating the TEU, the TFEU and, most notably, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (CFREU) with the «same legal value as the Treaties». Charter Fundamental Rights have turned to be, consequently, a parameter for examining the validity of secondary EU legislation, as well as for scrutinizing and reviewing the standard of compatibility of the national legislation of EU Member States with European law. The legal doctrine of the ECJ on fundamental rights has been particularly relevant in its impact on the data protection in the framework of the rights to privacy, privacy with regard to the electronic data transfer, and access to judicial protection of these rights (art. 7, 8 and 47 CFREU). It combines the principles of reservation of law (in due respect of its essential content) as well as proportionality and necessity for legislative measures that might affect them. But, moreover, this doctrine has had a decisive impact on the legal articulation of the so-called transatlantic partnership between the EU and the US, confronting data protection standards on both sides of the Atlantic and imposing guarantees of an «adequate level of protection» for all European citizens. This paper explores the impact of two recent relevant decisions by the ECJ - its rulings on Digital Rights Ireland case (2014) and on the Schrems case (2015) - upon the secondary EU legislation (Data Retention Directive of 2006, Data Protection Directive of 1995, and the «adequacy» Decision of the European Commission of 2000), as well as upon International Law instruments (Safe Harbour Agreement) between the EU and the US. It imposes, as a consequence, not only a negotiation that remedies the shortcomings detected in both decisions, but also a compelling updating of European law itself (new Data Protection Package in 2016) and a new US federal law, which, for the first time ever, provides European citizens with access to judicial remedies in U.S. Courts in defending their right to data protection (Judicial Redress Act, 2016).},
